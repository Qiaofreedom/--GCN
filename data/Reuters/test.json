        "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT\n  Mounting trade friction between the\n  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting\n  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\n  damage, businessmen and officials said.\n      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\n  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\n  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\n      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\n  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be\n  their gain.\n      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\n  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\n  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not\n  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\n      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\n  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\n  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\n  new taxes.\n      \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for\n  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\n  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.\n      \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\n  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\n  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom\n  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James\n  Capel and Co>.\n      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.\n      \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against\n  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior\n  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.\n      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\n  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.\n      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves\n  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.\n      \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\n  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\n  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said\n  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.\n      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion\n  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\n  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\n  are similar to those of Japan.\n      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\n  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\n      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\n  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\n  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\n  U.S.\n      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\n  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\n  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such\n  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\n  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n      \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\n  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n      \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\n  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\n  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,\n  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\n  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\n  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n      \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\n  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\n  serious matter,\" Button said.\n      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,\n  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant\n  U.S. Exports to that country.\n      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\n  trade stand-off continue.\n      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\n  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\n  and record public works spending in the first half of the\n  financial year.\n      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\n  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\n  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.\n      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\n  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and\n  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\n  effort to end the dispute.\n  \n\n",
        "CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS\n  A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities\n  showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China's grain\n  stocks, the China Daily said.\n      It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of\n  China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up\n  to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on\n  inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.\n      It said the government had launched a national programme to\n  reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and\n  preservation, and greater production of additives. The paper\n  gave no further details.\n  \n\n",
        "JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS\n  The Ministry of International Trade and\n  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand\n  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese\n  energy demand, ministry officials said.\n      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy\n  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600\n  mln, they said.\n      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in\n  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen\n  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.\n      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand\n  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the\n  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.\n      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy\n  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.\n      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power\n  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27\n  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and\n  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.\n  \n\n",
        "THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER\n  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5\n  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a\n  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.\n      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht\n  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this\n  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials\n  and semi-finished products.\n      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the\n  first quarter due to lower oil prices.\n      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6\n  billion baht from 56.6 billion.\n      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower\n  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose\n  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26\n  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.\n      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up\n  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.\n  \n\n",
        "INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY\n  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)\n  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB\n  sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall\n  in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree\n  crops, told Indonesian reporters.\n      Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332\n  dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.\n      Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite\n  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it\n  could possibly increase its international market share.\n      Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil\n  after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure\n  supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.\n      Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary\n  shortage than to lose export markets.\n      Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500\n  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank\n  figures.\n  \n\n",
        "AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT\n  Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),\n  Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on\n  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still\n  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.\n      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented\n  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.\n      The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration\n  Commission today.\n      Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the\n  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.\n      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week\n  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to\n  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.\n      The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to\n  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of\n  each shift and then to walk off.\n      Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with\n  container movements most affected, but has not stopped\n  altogether, they said.\n      They said they could not say how long the disruption will\n  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.\n  \n\n",
        "INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND\n  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is\n  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and\n  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian\n  Nainggolan said.\n      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in\n  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.\n      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil\n  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still\n  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no\n  decision on when to go ahead had been made.\n      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber\n  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.\n      \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.\n  \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a\n  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"\n      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee\n  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to\n  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are\n  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,\n  exchange officials said.\n      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the\n  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one\n  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No\n  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April\n  23, traders said.\n      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the\n  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should\n  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of\n  the exchange would help this.\n      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost\n  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.\n      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to\n  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would\n  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to\n  encourage participation.\n      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start\n  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.\n      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in\n  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9\n  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered\n  locally, the latest exchange report said.\n       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905\n  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.\n       Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and\n  44 traders.\n  \n\n",

        "SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER\n  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to\n  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of\n  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.\n      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9\n  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank\n  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in\n  October.\n      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu\n  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its\n  position.\n      \"We'll be back in position in first place within three\n  years,\" Komatsu said in an interview.\n      He said that while the merger will initially reduce\n  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand\n  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where\n  it has been relatively weak.\n      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how\n  quickly the gamble will pay off.\n      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in\n  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger\n  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\n  network from scratch.\n      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\n  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\n  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\n  wisdom of some of those moves.\n      \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\n  it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\n  financial analyst Simon Smithson.\n      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\n  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\n  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\n  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\n  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\n  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\n  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\n  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\n  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\n  into the securities business at home.\n      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\n  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\n  from investment banking.\n      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\n  said he hopes further deregulation will create new\n  opportunities.\n      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\n  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\n  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n      \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\n  in two or three years,\" he said.\n      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\n  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\n  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\n  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\n  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n      \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\n  Kleinwort's Smithson.\n      \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\n  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the\n  strategy is right or wrong.\"\n  \n\n",

Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has\n  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year\n  beef accord next March 31.\n      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales\n  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports\n  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although\n  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.\n      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its\n  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain\n  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.\n      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when\n  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has\n  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.\n  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing\n  some one billion dlrs in new business.\n      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs\n  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import\n  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,\n  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,\n  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.\n      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's\n  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove\n  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.\n      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional\n  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue\n  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the\n  industrial sector.\n      \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these\n  issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official\n  said.\n  \n\n",

But now\n  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.\n      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35\n  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this\n  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.\n      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a\n  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr\n  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the\n  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first\n  time.\n      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs\n  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest\n  in Asia.\n      \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the\n  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major\n  turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.\n      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of\n  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from\n  about 50 pct in 1986.\n      \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate\n  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he\n  said.\n      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation\n  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,\n  particularly the United States.\n      \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but\n  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a\n  proper level,\" Kim said.\n  \n\n",

        "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING\n  Australian markets are booming as foreign\n  fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\n  other traditional markets, analysts said.\n      High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\n  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\n  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\n  U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n      Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\n  and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\n  diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\n      A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\n  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\n  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n      Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\n  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\n  inquiries from Japan and the United States.\n      \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\n  and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\n  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and\n  reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\n  economist Brian Hamley said.\n      \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\n  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\n  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\n  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\n  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n      \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\n  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the\n  U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\n  said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\n  and the currency looks stable?\"\n      But turning that capital into more permanent productive\n  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n      \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\n  direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\n  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\n  economic statement on May 14.\n      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\n  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\n  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\n  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\n  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n      \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\n  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\n  might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\n  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\n  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n      \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\n  they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\n  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\n  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\n  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\n  policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\n  the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\n  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\n  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\n  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\n  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\n  Australian share market.

        "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY\n  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden\n  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\n  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\n  say.\n      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\n  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\n  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\n  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\n  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\n  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n      Factors depressing economic activity include the\n  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which\n  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the\n  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.\n      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\n  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\n  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\n  new debt settlement program was introduced.\n      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\n  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\n  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\n  still owed by individuals and companies.\n      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\n  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\n  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\n  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\n  will not allow any banks to go under.\n      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\n  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\n  debtors have regular cash flows or not.\n      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\n  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\n  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\n  is the biggest after oil.\n      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\n  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\n  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\n  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\n  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\n  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\n  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\n  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\n  crude.\n      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\n  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\n  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\n  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will\n  remain steady.\n      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\n  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\n  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\n  Gulf.\n      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\n  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\n  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\n  reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\n  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\n  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\n  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\n  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\n  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\n  shortfall.\n      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\n  economic growth this year or next.\n      \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\n  important.\"\n      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\n  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\n  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\n  economy.\n      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\n  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n  \n\n",

His petition said UCPB's\n  plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of\n  fiduciary duties.\"\n      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\n  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\n  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\n  government nominee on the company's board.\n      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,\n  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\n  the company's board.\n      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\n  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\n  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained\n  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\n  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\n  dividends.\n      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\n  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\n  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon\n  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\n  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\n  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\n  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\n  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong\n  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\n  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board\n  meeting.\n      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\n  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\n  April 15.\n      \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\n  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\n  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\n  disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in\n  a statement.\n      \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\n  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\n  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\n  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\n  of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.\n      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\n  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from\n  us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"\n      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\n  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\n  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\n  States citizen.\n      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,\n  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which\n  are available to foreign buyers.\n      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\n  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\n  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\n  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\n  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on\n  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\n  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\n  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\n  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\n  announced last June.\n      \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz\n  told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"\n      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\n  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'\n  meeting, scheduled for May 14.\n      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\n  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n  1985.

        "ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY\n  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\n  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\n  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\n  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\n  major company executives predicted.\n      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\n  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\n  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\n  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\n      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the\n  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\n  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\n      \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said\n  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,\n  \"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world\n  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\n  the old ones.\"\n      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\n  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\n  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\n  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\n  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\n  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\n  by as much as 300 pct, he said.\n      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\n  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\n  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its\n  history.\n      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\n  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\n  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\n  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\n  Oreffice said.\n      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\n  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\n  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\n  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\n  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\n  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.\n      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\n  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\n  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\n  U.S. chemical exports.\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\n  in the early 1980s.\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\n  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\n  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\n  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\n  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\n  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\n  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\n  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\n  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\n  along the Texas Gulf Coast.\n      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\n  are the building blocks of specialty products.\n      \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\n  glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\n  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\n  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\n  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\n  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\n  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the\n  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n  \n\n",

Morgan and Co Inc said its\n  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its\n  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status\n  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.\n      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest\n  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20\n  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the\n  first three months of 1986.\n      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities\n  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln\n  dlrs in the year-earlier period.\n      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading\n  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and\n  underwriting of Euromarket securities.\n      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained\n  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering\n  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether\n  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.\n      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan\n  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign\n  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and\n  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.\n      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and\n  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net\n  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.\n      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first\n  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell\n  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.\n      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means\n  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are\n  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9\n  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume\n  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\n      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for\n  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\n  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\n      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\n  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\n  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\n      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were\n  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\n  earlier.

The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do\n  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were\n  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.\n      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West\n  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage\n  capacity.\n      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and\n  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains\n  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.\n      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,\n  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to\n  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for\n  storing loose grain, Brito said.\n      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the\n  crops.\n      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop\n  has been evident from television reports, which have shown\n  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\n  \n\n",

        "TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>\n  The largest U.S. textile maker focused\n  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,\n  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself\n  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.\n      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose\n  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and\n  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct\n  stake.\n      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly\n  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover\n  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\n  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\"\n      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\n      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\n  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\n  Burlington actually came into play.\n      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\n  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\n  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\n  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\n  a U.S. acquisition.\n      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer\n  has been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but\n  would not say whether Burlington was among them.\n      \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not\n  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\n  housecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\n  McKinnon.\n      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\n  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs\n  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its\n  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\n  competition, Gormley said.\n      \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"\n  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\n  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\n  and other fabric to the auto industry.\n      \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\n  on the outlays they did make,\" she said.\n      \"You look at their record over the year, and I think\n  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\n  past,\" Gormley said.\n       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\n  from 2.01 dlrs per share.\n      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\n  at its current levels.\n      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\n  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\n  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\n  basis.\n      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\n  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\n      \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\n  don't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager.\n      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\n  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\n  he doesn't win the target company.\n      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\n  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying\n  Ponderosa Inc.\n      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with\n  Burlington.\n      J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest\n  Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and\n  Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

To\n  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by\n  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\"\n      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough\n  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.\n  \n\n",

        "HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION\n  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\n  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\n  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\n  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\n  to extend world penetration.\n      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\n  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\n      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's\n  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\n  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\n      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\n  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\n  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\n      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\n  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\n      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\n  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila\n  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\n  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\n  regionalized.\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n  1986 sales.\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\n  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\n  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\n  money.\n  \n\n",

UAL last month said New York Real estate developer\n  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also\n  held discussions with its chairman.\n      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the\n  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.\n      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying\n  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2\n  mln shares.\n      \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the\n  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,\n  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL\n  management,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.\n      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack\n  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz\n  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a\n  strategy to become a travel service company.\n      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union\n  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention\n  on its airline.\n      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its\n  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.\n      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has\n  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100\n  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as\n  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe\n  the stock is in play.\n      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted\n  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a\n  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps\n  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.\n      \"The first domino is you have an investor with a\n  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type\n  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\"\n  said Pettee.\n      \"What's interesting is the values are there.

        "DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT\n  Financial analysts say they are\n  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal\n  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help\n  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.\n      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow\n  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming\n  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.\n      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan\n  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next\n  year.\n          \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is\n  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little\n  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley\n  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.\n      \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander\n  said in an interview.\n      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly\n  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way\n  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease\n  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.\n      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade\n  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker\n  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\n  with danger.\n      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\n  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\n  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\n  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\n  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\n  should be stabilized at around current levels.\n      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\n  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\n  agreed to cut its budget deficit.\n      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\n  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\n  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n      \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\n  you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\n  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\n  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\n  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\n  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\n  States.\n      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\n  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\n  that any deficit reduction was better than none.\n      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \n  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\n  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\n  from plunging further in world exchange markets.\n      \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\n  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\n  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\n  is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\n  most vexing and persistent problems.\n      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\n  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\n  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by\n  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\n      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\n  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\n  federal budget.\n      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\n  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\n  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\n  budget law.\n      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\n  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\n  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\n  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n      \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\n  most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\n  said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that\n  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\n  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n      \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\n  reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\n  look like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\n  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\n  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\n  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\n  anticipated spending levels for next year.\n      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\n  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \n  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n  \n\n",

        "MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN\n  American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs\n  acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor\n  business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by\n  the tobacco company, analysts said.\n       \"They were very frustrated with their inability to get\n  Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It\n  doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,\" said\n  Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.\n      American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion\n  dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to\n  buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been\n  speculating that American Brands would find another candidate\n  to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.\n      \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of\n  Prudential-Bache securities. \"There's going to be more to come\n  here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because\n  tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position\n  is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,\"\n  he said.\n  cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business\n  does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can\n  therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the\n  National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin\n  and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the\n  type of acquisition they envisioned.\n      \"The distilled spirits business has been in a steady\n  gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,\"\n  said Thompson.\n   REUTER...\n  \n\n",
        "BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION\n  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\n  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to\n  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\n      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\n  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\n  protectionism and control on capital movements.\n      \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\n  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\n  them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\n  determined market trends.\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\n  rise faster than GNP.\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\n  investment in the U.S.\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n  \n\n",

        "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY\n  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and\n  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force\n  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.\n      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.\n  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of\n  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,\n  they said.\n      \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of\n  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\"\n  said one diplomatic source.\n      \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source\n  said.\n      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not\n  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts\n  said.\n      \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not\n  so internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru\n  Uchida. \"Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world\n  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to\n  face the situation.\"\n      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with\n  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep\n  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in\n  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.\n      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival\n  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one\n  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now\n  monopolizes the business.\n      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned\n  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on\n  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.\n      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has\n  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger\n  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open\n  its telecommunications market.\n      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it\n  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car\n  telephone and satellite communications market.\n      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the\n  sector it regulates.\n      \"What has been happening is an important shift in the\n  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said\n  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory\n  Service Inc.\n      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to\n  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted\n  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.\n      \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto\n  legal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell\n  Whitten.\n      Close links with the powerful political faction of the\n  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime\n  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the\n  analysts said.\n      \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka\n  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance\n  of MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\n  the influential political group, he added.\n      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\n  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\n  Postal Savings System, analysts said.\n      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\n  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\n  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\n  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than\n  banks, they said.\n      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's\n  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\n  the ministry as feudal.\n      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\n  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\n  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\n  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of\n  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\n  including Britain, several analysts said.\n      \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n  \"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\n  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\n  view,\" he said.\n  \n\n",

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\n  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\n  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\n  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\n  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\n  possibly to 140 yen.\n      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\n  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\n  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\n  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\n  operators to test the downside.\n      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\n  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\n  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\n  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\n  near term, the traders said.\n      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\n  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\n  downward trend.\n      Traders in several centres said the market would look for\n  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\n  defend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\n  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\n  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n  \"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The\n  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\n  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\n  Easter weekend.

AEGON did not specify the loss.\n      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and\n  life insurance was lower.

The yen sank below 145 at one point\n  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the\n  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\n  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n      \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\n  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\n  discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\n      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\n  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\n  Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's\n  meetings of leading industrial nations.\n      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n  \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\n  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\n  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\n  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\n  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\n  foster exchange rate stability.\n      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\n  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\n  dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\n  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\n  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that\n  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\n  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n      They also said there was a growing feeling among the\n  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\n  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\n  differences in past meetings.\n      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\n  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\n  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\n  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n      Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\n  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\n  between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\n  trade deficit have already taken place.\n      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\n  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the\n  reafffirmation of Paris.\n      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\n  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\n  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\n  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\n  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\n  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\n  undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\n  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\n  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\n  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\n  dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\n  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\n  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\n  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\n  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n      The United States and France, backed by the International\n  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\n  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,\n  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\n  account balances.\n      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\n  consultations between the countries on whether corrective\n  action should be required.\n      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\n  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\n  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\n  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\n  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\n  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\n  relatively free currency markets of recent years.\n  \n\n",
        "BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED\n  The Bank of France said it left its\n  intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds\n  in the market against first category paper in today's money\n  market intervention tender.\n      Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on\n  the possibility of quarter point cut.\n      The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was cut to\n  7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January.\n  \n\n",
        "GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS\n  The global economy is expected to\n  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious\n  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.\n      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this\n  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\n  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an\n  additional concern.\n      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct\n  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.\n      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a\n  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to\n  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.\n      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,\n  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0\n  pct from 3.5 pct last year.\n      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to\n  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the\n  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\n  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\n  with growing mounds of debt.\n      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\n  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual\n  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\n      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\n  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\n  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\n      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\n  states for markets for their products as well as financial\n  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' \n  economies poses fundamental worries.\n      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\n  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\n  including the key one of exports.\n      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\n  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\n  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\n  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\n      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\n  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\n  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.\n      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\n  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\n  deficit.\n      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\n  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\n  slower than expected.\n      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has\n  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\n  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\n  to get a resonably complete effect.\"\n      The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even\n  more time on this occasion.\"\n  REUTER^M\n  \n\n",
        "SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES\n  The head of Spain's employers'\n  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried\n  about the government's monetary policies because high real\n  interest rates were hampering investment.\n      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this\n  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation\n  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by\n  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\n  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\n  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\n  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\n  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\n  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\n  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n  11.8 at end-1986.\n      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\n  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\n  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\n  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\n  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\n  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\n  pct wage ceiling.\n      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\n  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\n  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\n  increase over the corresponding period last year.\n      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\n  peseta to correct the imbalance.\n  \n\n",

        "LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS\n  Lead prices have risen this week against\n  a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders\n  said.\n      Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying\n  or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.\n      London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at\n  a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and\n  prices tending to drift lower.\n      This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low\n  level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical\n  demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.\n      The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be\n  felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,\n  stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders\n  said.\n      The lower supply levels result from a number of different\n  factors around the globe.\n      Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries\n  because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish\n  exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at\n  Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant\n  additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have\n  been drawing on LME stocks.\n      In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,\n  South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks\n  for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet\n  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n      And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\n  per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\n  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\n  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\n  a regular supplier to the world market.\n      Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\n  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n      On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\n  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\n  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\n  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\n  order was filled by merchants in March.\n      Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\n  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\n  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\n  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\n  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\n  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n      On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\n  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\n  and this is believed to be in strong hands.\n      Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\n  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\n  which are not popular with merchants putting together\n  shipments.\n      But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\n  the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\n  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\n  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\n  the transport of used batteries.\n      Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\n  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\n  expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\n  Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n      Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\n  expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\n  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n      Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\n  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\n  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\n  to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at\n  midsession.\n  \n\n",

VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and\n  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend\n  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has\n  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,\n  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held\n  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.\n      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5\n  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment\n  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,\n  since the new capital was in preference shares.\n      The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in\n  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels.

The important thing is that it\n  continue year after year,\" Lawson said.\n      The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\n  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\n  weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\n  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\n      Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\n  the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been\n  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"\n      Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\n  said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n  ... but one has to be vigilant.\"\n      He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n  \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n  \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the\n  same thing,\" he said.\n      Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\n  measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\n  weakness for that agreement.\n      Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's\n  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\n  domestic demand.\n      They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\n  increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\n  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\n  the second half of this year.\n  \n\n",

        "DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT\n  The dollar drifted down to end one\n  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the\n  lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and\n  comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.\n      Dealers said the communique early in the European morning\n  from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and\n  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further\n  attempts to push it lower through the day.\n      The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below\n  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.\n      Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was\n  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to\n  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated\n  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the\n  Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.\n      Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7\n  as \"soft as wax.\"\n      Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in\n  a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no\n  current reason to change monetary course at present.\n      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks\n  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West\n  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers\n  said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts\n  may be under consideration.\n      German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70\n  pct after 3.80 yesterday.\n      Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added\n  via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next\n  week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation\n  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.\n      But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger\n  said, \"since the central bank council gives its opinion on this\n  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.\"\n      Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers\n  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around\n  3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional\n  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.\n      Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965\n  last night.

        "TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES\n  Steel stocks, which have had a healthy\n  runup recently, still present some short term investment\n  opportunities, according to some steel analysts.\n      But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm\n  prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end\n  soon. They recommend taking profits.\n      \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said\n  Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be\n  strong for about two months, and there are signs that some\n  (order rates) are starting to dive already.\"\n      But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\n  some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\n  &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel\n  Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.\n      \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\n  short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\n  rising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\n  however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\n  make them more efficient.\n      Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to\n  recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\n      Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\n  sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\n  has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\n  noted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but\n  they've come a long way,\" he said.\n      \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the\n  market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\n  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n      Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\n  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\n  against losses last year.\n      Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\n  said.\n      Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\n  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\n  it,\" he said.\n      The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\n  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\n  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\n  depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales\n  come from oil and natural gas.\n      Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\n  Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot\n  (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit\n  for,\" she said.\n      She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\n  trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\n  share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n  1986.\n      Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\n  been recommending the stocks since last November.\n      Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\n  although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\n  third quarter.\n      But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)\n  prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"\n  he said.\n      Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\n  dropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than\n  negatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\n  industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\n  cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\n  \n\n",

        "U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER\n  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales\n  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a\n  recovery in April.\n      \"Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but\n  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,\" said\n  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.\n       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and\n  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This\n  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three\n  weeks later than last year.\n      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said\n  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a\n  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted\n  5.7 pct last year.\n      \"The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate\n  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear\n  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,\" said\n  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.\n      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in\n  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected\n  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.\n       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\n  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\n  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\n  holiday nears.\n      \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\n  continuing strength in the housing market,\" said Edward\n  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an\n  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's\n  sportswear were also excellent.\n      \"Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even\n  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment\n  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\"\n  said C.J.

Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were\n  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales\n  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and\n  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's\n  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.\n      Penney chairman William Howell said, \"Sales continued\n  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from\n  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed\n  southwest.\"\n      \"Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity\n  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,\n  but are currently hurting sales,\" said Greenstein of Bear\n  Stearns.\n      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for\n  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \"Hudson had a tougher\n  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\"\n      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower\n  than last year.\n      \"Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are\n  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales\n  are coming through anyway,\" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.\n      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  \n  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of\n  the year.\n      Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of\n  May.\n       MARCH RETAIL SALES FOR MAJOR U.S. RETAILERS\n      STORE       PCT        1987       1986\n      SEARS       4.2     2.6 BIL       2.5 BIL \n      K MART      4.6     2.2 BIL       2.1 BIL \n      JC PENNEY  (1.3)    1.1 BIL       1.1 BIL \n      WAL-MART     32     1.1 BIL       855 MLN\n      FEDERATED   4.9     934 MLN       891 MLN\n      MAY         3.5     885 MLN       855 MLN\n      DAYTON      4.8     792 MLN       756 MLN\n      WOOLWORTH   0.2     591 MLN       590 MLN\n      ZAYRE      12.7     522 MLN       464 MLN\n  \n\n",

We are\n  still awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be\n  identified.\n      Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of\n  high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had\n  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and\n  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.\n      Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be\n  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low\n  prices, the source said.

In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion\n  dlrs.\n      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\n  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\n  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\n  closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\n  afternoon trading.\n      Economists have been banking on an improved trade\n  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\n  Canadian economy.\n      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\n  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\n  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\n  closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\n  afternoon trading.\n      Economists have been banking on an improved trade\n  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\n  Canadian economy.\n      They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at\n  a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays\n  this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into\n  the country.\n      Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United\n  States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be\n  strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer\n  spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.\n      \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export\n  performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's\n  Donegan.\n      But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist\n  Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and\n  said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's\n  trade upturn.\n      Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing\n  signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate\n  that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is\n  probably transitory.\"\n  \n\n",

        "HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE\n  The House Armed Services Committee\n  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled\n  materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.\n      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and\n  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.\n      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill\n  which will be voted on in the House next month.\n      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee\n  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage\n  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a\n  staff member of the committee told Reuters.\n      \"They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being\n  managed properly,\" said the staffer. \"Management of the stockpile\n  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.\"\n      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a\n  White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n      The staffer said that under the measures passed by the\n  committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence\n  over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.\n      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs\n  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The\n  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\n  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\n  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\n  management was counter-productive, he said.\n  \n\n",

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry\n  Research Associates.\n      Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference\n  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much\n  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high\n  level of 47 pct in 1977.\n      \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is\n  inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil\n  imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.\n      Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for\n  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to\n  40 pct by 1990.\n      \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected\n  positively or negatively through government action or\n  inaction,\" Lichtblau said.\n      He said that one of the government's negative actions is\n  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a\n  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash\n  flow for oil exploration.\n      Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor\n  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.\n      \"An international floor price adopted by all or most\n  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective\n  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if\n  we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.\n      Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic\n  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen\n  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.\n      A potential for alternative supplies could limit the\n  willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.\n      Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer\n  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic\n  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans\n  for alternative energy.\n  \n\n",

        "ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE\n  Economists said that they doubt the\n  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite\n  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week\n  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.\n      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged\n  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln\n  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were\n  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\n      \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\n  probably isn't,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\n      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\n  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\n  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\n  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\n      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\n  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\n  often pushes up borrrowings.\n      \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\n  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\n  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,\" said\n  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\n  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\n  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\n      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\n  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\n  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\n      The Fed took no market reserve management action last\n  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\n  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\n      \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\n  this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\n      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\n  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\n  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\n  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the\n  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\n      \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\n  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\n  tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\n      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\n  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\n  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed\n  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\n      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\n  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\n  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\n  imbalance between the United States and Japan.\n      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\n  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\n  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\n  the rate has been since early November.\n      \"I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\n  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\n  Dean Witter.\n      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\n  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\n  six to 6.10 pct previously.\n  \n\n",

        "U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE\n  Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial\n  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's\n  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that\n  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.\n      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline\n  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n      \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\n  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\n  by 33 points to 2339.\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\n  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\n  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n      \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n      \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\n  massive budget deficit.\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\n  weakness,\" he said.\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n      \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\n  will have been greater.\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.\n  \n\n",

Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not\n  sell any assets, Kinnear said.\n      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of\n  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under\n  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.\n      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the\n  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on\n  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for\n  bankruptcy.\n      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a\n  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. \"Texaco\n  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go\n  to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said.\n      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would\n  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were\n  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.\n  \n\n",

Payments on remaining debt would be linked to\n  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.\n      \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that\n  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that\n  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"\n  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in\n  Calgary.\n      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome\n  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed\n  refinancing packages, Gobert said.\n      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome\n  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders\n  to agree to a restructuring, he added.\n      \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain\n  any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.\n      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that\n  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix\n  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other\n  possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to\n  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little\n  reluctant to come forward,\" he said.\n      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal\n  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a\n  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.\n      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions\n  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other\n  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and\n  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including\n  TransCanada's.\n      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price\n  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.\n      However, he said not enough financial details are known\n  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of\n  TransCanada's proposed offer.\n  \n\n",

        "INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY\n  The five leading West German economic\n  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the\n  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down\n  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.\n      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen\n  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross\n  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared\n  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast\n  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\n  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n      The joint report said that the estimates of economic\n  development made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\n  favourable\" than those of the other three.\n      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\n  slow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\n  however, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n      The two institutes said external economic factors which\n  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\n  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\n  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\n  marked improvement in the course of the year.\n      The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\n  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\n  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\n  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\n  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\n  but only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n      They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\n  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\n  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\n  demand and production could be expected by the spring.\n      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\n  further development of the mark against the dollar.\n      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\n  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the\n  economy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\n  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\n  the course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\n  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\n  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\n  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\n  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\n  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\n  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\n  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\n  work of about 200,000.\n      These three institutes said new jobs would be created\n  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\n  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry\n  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\n  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the\n  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\n  in the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\n  manufacturing industry will decline.\"\n      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\n  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\n  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\n  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\n  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\n      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\n  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\n  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.\n  \n\n",

        "WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS\n  The five leading West German economic\n  research institutes said the government should do more to\n  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of\n  tax cuts planned for 1990.\n      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided\n  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct\n  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national\n  product grew 2.4 pct last year.\n      But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more\n  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional\n  jobs can be created.\"\n      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic\n  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this\n  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be\n  brought forward.\"\n      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion\n  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from\n  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.\n      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only\n  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of\n  its financing had been left open.\n      The government has not specified how the remaining 19\n  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,\n  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.\n      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had\n  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what\n  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a\n  quick decision from the government.\n      They also said the government should reduce tax\n  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a\n  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in\n  value-added tax.\n      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing\n  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.\n      They referred specifically to a doubling of special\n  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a\n  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this\n  as an increase in subsidies.\n      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax\n  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen\n  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it\n  should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to\n  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.\n      The institutes said that if the government raised value\n  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the\n  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.\n      The report also noted that the government was progressing\n  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and\n  said more deregulation was needed.

        "G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION\n  Top officials of leading industrial\n  nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have\n  ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they\n  believe they strengthened in talks last week.\n      Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the\n  markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely\n  disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the\n  policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,\n  Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.\n      Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to\n  reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a\n  statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur\n  underscored that by saying: \"I don't believe at all that the\n  Americans want a weaker dollar.\"\n      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the\n  dollar's latest rapid descent \"involves the risk -- now already\n  a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,\n  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.\"\n      But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared\n  the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they\n  could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies\n  settled into a stable pattern as a result.\n      Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's\n  semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher\n  U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid\n  descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n      Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\n  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\n  the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n      \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\n  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\n  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n  (into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n      Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\n  dollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\n  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\n  not healthy.\"\n      And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\n  recession, he said.\n      Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\n  life, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\n  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n      But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\n  might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n      U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\n  understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n      \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\n  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\n  agreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n      Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\n  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\n  decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\n  stabilizing currencies at current levels.\n      Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n  22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\n  to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\n  protectionism.\n      West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\n  domestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n      Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\n  promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n      The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\n  action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\n  currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\n  the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n      The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\n  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\n  the policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n      Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\n  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\n  with the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\n  view that around current levels their currencies are within\n  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\n  statement read.\n      Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\n  focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\n  Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\n  rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary\n  sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant\n  business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.\n  \n\n",

Payments on remaining debt would be linked to\n  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.\n      \"The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that\n  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that\n  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,\"\n  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in\n  Calgary.\n      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome\n  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed\n  refinancing packages, Gobert said.\n      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome\n  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders\n  to agree to a restructuring, he added.\n      \"I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain\n  any and all offers (for Dome),\" Gobert said.\n      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that\n  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix\n  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other\n  possible buyers from making an offer. \"By drawing attention to\n  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little\n  reluctant to come forward,\" he said.\n      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal\n  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a\n  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.\n      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions\n  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other\n  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and\n  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including\n  TransCanada's.\n      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price\n  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.\n      However, he said not enough financial details are known\n  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of\n  TransCanada's proposed offer.\n  \n\n",

The offer had\n  been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he\n  had received a \"negligible\" number of shares in response to the\n  offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.\n      Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln\n  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a\n  primary basis.\n      Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan\n  as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders\n  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject\n  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in\n  June.\n      The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln\n  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.\n      Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the\n  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to\n  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on\n  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New\n  Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.\n      He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all\n  of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a\n  merger transaction.\n      Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares\n  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,\n  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.\n      He said he still has received only a \"negligible\" number of\n  shares in response to his tender.\n      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in\n  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April\n  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to\n  increase the price of his offer.\n      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in\n  place.\n      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered\n  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing\n  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding\n  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.\n      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a\n  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr\n  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for\n  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to\n  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the\n  purchase of shares under the offer.\n      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,\n  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,\n  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into\n  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an\n  independent investment baking firm.\n      He said \"To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares\n  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a\n  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value\n  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.\"\n      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to\n  Caesars' recapitalization.\n      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming\n  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory\n  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it\n  already underway in New Jersey.\n      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely\n  duration of the regulatory process.\n      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the\n  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.\n  \n\n",

        "PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS\n  Portugal's economy, which has been\n  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,\n  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest\n  government crisis, analysts said.\n      But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco\n  Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment\n  as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European\n  Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.\n      Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was\n  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.\n      The centre-right administration had made economic growth\n  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.\n      In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current\n  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and\n  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.\n      Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability\n  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued\n  growth had not been badly shaken.\n      \"The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is\n  now less dependent on the political situation,\" said Fritz\n  Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.\n      \"The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,\" economist\n  Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.\n      Businessmen have identified political instability over the\n  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting\n  economic progress.\n      The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974\n  revolution.\n      Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain\n  buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge\n  in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely\n  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.\n      Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of\n  Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,\n  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth\n  would remain at similar levels this year.\n      But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies\n  and could slow economic development.\n      Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end\n  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new\n  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated\n  parliament.\n      Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick\n  elections as the best solution. \"There is a good chance that a\n  majority government could result from early elections,\"\n  Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro\n  Ferraz da Costa said.\n      He said they were optimistic this could mean the\n  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies\n  introduced over the last year.\n      The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but\n  the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls\n  say they could win an overall majority.\n      A PSD majority would also open the way for more\n  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and\n  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.\n      Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties\n  of blocking key economic reforms.\n      The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results\n  were more the product of favourable international conditions\n  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD\n  policies.\n  \n\n",

        "GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY\n  Four of West Germany's five leading\n  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary\n  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.\n      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,\n  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said\n  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not\n  necessarily threaten stability.\n      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which\n  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in\n  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.\n      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in\n  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has\n  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price\n  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.\n      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may\n  seem exaggerated, they said.\n      \"But it has often turned out in the past that the price\n  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into\n  a restrictive policy,\" they said.\n      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are\n  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.\n      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary\n  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic\n  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market\n  investments following lower interest rates.\n      \"Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of\n  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a\n  smaller expansion of money supply,\" they said.\n      A return to growth and stability did not require\n  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with\n  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid\n  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.\n      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be\n  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of\n  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic\n  weakness other factors should be taken into account.\n      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts\n  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation\n  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat\n  in itself to price stability.\n      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth\n  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the\n  falling mark.\n  \n\n",

Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for\n  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and\n  securities for the balance.\n      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.\n      \"I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in\n  with another bid,\" said one analyst, who values the company at\n  51 or 52 dlrs per share.\n      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of\n  Borg-Warner's stock.\n      \"You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up\n  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have\n  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking\n  at it - that it's worth more,\" Pershing and Co analyst Richard\n  Henderson said.\n      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.\n      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill\n  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.\n      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\n  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\n  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as\n  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.\n      \"Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical\n  operation these days,\" said Henderson.\n      \"He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he\n  does not like to get pushed around,\" said Henderson.\n      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover\n  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF\n  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its\n  investment in Carbide.\n      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its\n  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer\n  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would\n  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.\n      \"It's a win-win situation,\" said one analyst.\n      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be\n  forthcoming shortly.\n      \"I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this\n  book,\" he said.\n      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,\n  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security\n  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.\n      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows\n  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it\n  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per\n  share.\n      \"I think there's a probability he goes up in price,\" said\n  Rose.\n      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman\n  would do. \"Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.\"\n      \"Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical\n  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,\" Rose\n  said.\n      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add\n  earnings momentum to GAF. \"I worked out that paying as much as\n  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if\n  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,\" said John\n  Henry of E.F. Hutton.\n      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986\n  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion\n  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net\n  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.\n      \"The Borg chemical business is great,\" said Rose, adding\n  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow\n  Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.\n  \n\n",

        "EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE\n  U.S. officials said they held out\n  little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a\n  controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into\n  effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut\n  off their exports.\n      But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.\n  plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year\n  provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.\n  Agriculture Department.\n      The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will\n  require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC\n  inspection standards beginning April 30.\n      The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting\n  the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.\n      At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln\n  dlrs in 1985.\n      The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes\n  in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing\n  to use of wood.\n      Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,\n  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved\n  without further review. USDA would have to certify that the\n  plants had corrected the deficiencies.\n      All remaining plants with a history or potential of\n  shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more\n  significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before\n  further EC review.\n      Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat\n  Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal\n  trade retaliation petition by April 30.\n      An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft\n  petition.\n      An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said\n  U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,\n  but that \"the chances of that are not too good at this time.\"\n      However, there is the \"expectation\" in U.S. government and\n  meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow\n  shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from\n  U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring\n  their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the\n  USTR official said.\n  \n\n",
        "U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON\n  Major U.S. banks may lift prime\n  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in\n  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is\n  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.\n      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most\n  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to\n  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own\n  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\n  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\n  percentage point.\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\n      \"We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\n      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\n  market than most economists had expected.\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\n      \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\n  said Jones of Lanston.\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said.

        "U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE\n  The U.S. International Trade\n  Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to\n  impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen\n  concentrated orange juice.\n      The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in\n  its final ruling on the matter.\n      Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce\n  Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an\n  anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen\n  concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator\n  said.\n      The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have\n  injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already\n  ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to\n  1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision\n  last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.\n      The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on\n  imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since\n  Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.\n      Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --\n  Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.\n      Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.\n  supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,\n  the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of\n  Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.\n      Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon\n  tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.\n      An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final\n  report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.\n      Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and\n  transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries\n  dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing\n  duties, Vastagh said.\n      He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,\n  including three major shippers, would be affected by the\n  decision.\n  \n\n",

Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.\n  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\n  to cover transactions, it said.\n      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\n  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\n  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over\n  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\n      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\n  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\n      \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\n  could,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\n  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\n  supplies.\n      \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\n  avalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we\n  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\"\n      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\n  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\n  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\n  said.\n      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\n  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\n  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\n  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.\n      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last\n  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today\n  said, \"a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on\n  supplying. They had cancelled last week.\"\n      He declined to identify the company.\n      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil\n  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also\n  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.\n      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the\n  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key\n  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the\n  Algerians, he added.\n      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter\n  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines\n  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.\n      \"It will be business as usual for Texaco,\" said Martin\n  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer\n  and Traub.\n      \"Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,\" he said. \"But\n  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and\n  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.\"\n      But other officials at Texaco were not immediately\n  available to say whether discussions were being held with its\n  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.\n  \n\n",

In recent months, Dome\n  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.\n      TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\n  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\n  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\n  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\n      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\n  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\n  stressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial\n  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.\"\n      \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\n  &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian\n  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert\n  of Peters and Co Ltd.\n      David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\n  Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\n  BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\n  of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.\n      Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\n  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks\n  with Dome.\n      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\n  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\n      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully\n  optimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\n  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\n  dlrs Canadian per common share.\n      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\n  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\n  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\n  would own 80 pct.\n      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\n  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The\n  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"\n  he said.\n      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the\n  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\"\n      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\n  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\n  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\n  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\n  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\n      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\n  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\n  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company\n  wanted to expand.\n      \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\n  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\n  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"\n  Gobert said.\n      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\n  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\n  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\n  cubic feet of natural gas.\n      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\n  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\n  heart of Canada's oil industry.\n     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\n  land across Canada.\n     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\n  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of\n  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the\n  largest ever by a Canadian company.\n  \n\n",

        "JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS\n  Basic reform of Japan's protected farm\n  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to\n  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade\n  surplus, securities analysts said.\n      The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and\n  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and\n  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they\n  said.\n      \"In economic terms, reform would be a plus,\" said Christopher\n  Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.\n      The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices\n  twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,\n  The analysts said.\n      Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the\n  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross\n  national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.\n      Reducing these prices could increase household spending\n  power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on\n  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting\n  domestic growth, it added.\n      \"There's a lot of slack,\" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo\n  said. \"All that money could be spent on something else.\"\n      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector\n  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent\n  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37\n  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.\n      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm\n  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential\n  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,\n  economists said.\n      \"Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the\n  expansion of domestic demand,\" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor\n  at Kyoto Gakuen University.\n      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform\n  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic\n  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the\n  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. \"If you really\n  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to\n  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,\" Bumpei\n  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'\n  Associations told a recent press conference.\n      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek\n  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade\n  deficits with Japan.\n      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well\n  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.\n      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there\n  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban\n  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on\n  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several\n  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.\n      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform\n  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,\n  the analysts said.\n      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the\n  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for\n  national food security, they said.\n      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to\n  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms\n  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.\n      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific\n  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.\n  \n\n",

Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually\n  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because\n  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese\n  mandarin orange industry.\n      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because\n  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And\n  Japanese officials have said.\n     Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy\n  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,\n  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.\n     Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,\n  including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in\n  Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain\n  minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.\n  \n\n",

        "REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS\n  President Reagan today is to\n  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to\n  retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair\n  practices in semiconductor trade.\n      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of\n  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of\n  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.\n      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs\n  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors\n  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.\n      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some\n  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa\n  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.\n      In his March annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to\n  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide\n  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.\"\n      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the\n  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world\n  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.\n      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March\n  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.\n      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  \"we\n  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of\n  action that requires meaningful action.\"\n      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,\n  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.\n      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.\n      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to\n  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.\n      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent\n  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that\n  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.\n      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was\n  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not\n  need any new trade legislation.\n      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring\n  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the\n  results showed up.\n      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of\n  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and\n  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the\n  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.\n      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would\n  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade\n  (GATT).\n      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had\n  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would\n  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.\n      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would\n  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with\n  the United States.\n  \n\n",

        "JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING\n  The tough trade sanctions President\n  Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across\n  Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade\n  practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.\n      But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings\n  Institution, a think tank, said \"a shot across their bow can\n  often result in a shot in our stern.\"\n      He said it left the United States open to retaliation.\n      The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered\n  on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress\n  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,\n  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.\n      In the past year tough trade action had been taken against\n  the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer\n  and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,\n  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.\n      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the\n  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a \"serious signal\"\n  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.\n      Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,\n  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor\n  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at\n  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The\n  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other\n  sources so there would be little effect on the American\n  consumer, Fitzwater said.\n      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\n  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\n  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\n      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\n      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\n  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\n  one-third of America's overall deficit.\n      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\n  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\n  president is ready to fight them all.\n      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that \"I regret\n  that these actions are necessary,\" but that the health and\n  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\n  American competitiveness in world markets.\n      \"We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\n  practices,\" Reagan added in the statement from his California\n  vacation home at Santa Barbara.\n      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\n  abided by the agreement.\n      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\n  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\n  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\n      The White House aide said of the tariff action, \"it wasn't\n  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\n  practice.\"\n      The aide added, however, \"on another plane, it was an\n  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\n  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\n  overall of our trade laws.\"\n      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\n  in the best interests of the United States, and that\n  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\n      \"It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,\" he\n  said, \"because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\n  trade.\"\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n      But other analysts said it made little difference whether\n  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\n  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on\n  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n      Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\n  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\n  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n      Crandall said, \"the administration is doing this for its\n  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact\n  on Congress.\"\n      He said, \"I don't think it makes a lot of sense.\"\n      But other analysts said it made little difference whether\n  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\n  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on\n  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\n      Spokesman Fitzwater said \"we don't want a trade war,\" but the\n  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\n  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\n  \n\n",

        "FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY\n  U.S. banking data released today are\n  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary\n  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the\n  Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,\n  economists said.\n      \"It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount\n  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\n  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\n  with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\n  Corp.\n      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\n  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\n      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\n  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\n  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\n  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\n      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\n  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\n  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\n  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\n  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.\n      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\n  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\n  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\n  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\n      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\n  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\n  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\n  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\n  pay annual income taxes.\n      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\n  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\n      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\n  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\n  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\n  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\n  add reserves too late.\n      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\n  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\n  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\n  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\n  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\n  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\n      \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\n  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"\n  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\n      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\n  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\n  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\n      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\n  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\n  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \n  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the\n  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\n      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\n  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\n  figures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\n  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"\n      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\n  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\n  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\n      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\n  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\n  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\n  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.\n  \n\n",

It gave no 1986 area figures.\n      The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national\n  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under\n  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.\n      It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and\n  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm\n  commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1\n  hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan\n  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.\n      It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only\n  gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.\n  \n\n",

        "U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE\n  The use of tariffs and quotas to\n  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do\n  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government\n  study said.\n      In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,\n  such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less\n  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of\n  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.\n      \"Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than\n  help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,\" it said.\n      The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke\n  and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which\n  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting\n  currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.\n      Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as\n  foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial\n  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions\n  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.\n      \"Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level\n  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find\n  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes\n  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in\n  the overall trade deficit,\" the study said.\n      \"To the extent any government action is needed to deal with\n  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide\n  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,\"\n  the FTC study said.\n      Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts\n  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report\n  said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some\n  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.\n      It also said it found a \"fairly direct relationship\" between\n  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting\n  currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic\n  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign\n  consumer demand.\n      The study examined seven factors which have been commonly\n  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and\n  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of\n  investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development\n  in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil\n  prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.\n      In each case, the study found little or no evidence that\n  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.\n  \n\n",

        "PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX\n  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)\n  chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this\n  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community\n  (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.\n      \"I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting\n  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries\n  like the Philippines,\" Romero said in an interview.\n      He said he did not know how much support the levy had\n  within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed\n  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.\n      Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the\n  Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But\n  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\n  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\n      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\n  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\n  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\n      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\n  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\n  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\n  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\n      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\n  is not properly dried or ground.\n      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\n  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\n  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\n  but this was likely to take several years of research.\n      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\n  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\n      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\n  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\n  avoiding the copra process altogether.\n      \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\n  copra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying\n  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\n  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\n  the chemical root.\"\n      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\n  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of\n  coconut products to drop.\n      \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\n  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he\n  said.\n      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\n  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\n  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\n      \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\n  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\n  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"\n  he said.\n      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\n  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\n  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\n  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\n      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\n  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\n  after two successive years of good harvests.\n      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\n  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.\n      \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\n  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\n  prices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.\n      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\n  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\n      \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\n  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,\" Romero\n  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program\n  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they\n  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.\n      \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,\n  production and employment then it won't happen,\" he said.\n      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's\n  population is dependent on the coconut industry.\n      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or\n  one-fourth of total agricultural land.\n  \n\n",
        "PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE\n  Crude oil prices could remain around 18\n  dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on\n  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an\n  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos\n  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.\n      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of\n  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared\n  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself\n  for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was\n  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than\n  envisaged a few months ago,\" he said.\n      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of\n  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the\n  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been\n  envisaged might soften price levels.\n      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in\n  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.\n      \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in\n  terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said.\n      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted\n  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is\n  always there as a possibility, he said.\n      \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I\n  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and\n  discipline will be maintained,\" he said.\n      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as\n  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil\n  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during\n  1987 if output remains under control.\n      He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that\n  increased production was not so important as long as incomes\n  would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and\n  welcome from such a powerful producer.\"\n  \n\n",

The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of\n  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a\n  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct\n  convertible debentures.\n      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by\n  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for\n  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent\n  conveyance.\n      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose\n  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it\n  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to\n  repay it.\n      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to\n  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an\n  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed\n  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.\n      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,\n  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the\n  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its\n  alternatives.\n      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation\n  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt\n  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on\n  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.\n      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous\n  increase effective on the June eight record date for the\n  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon\n  conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged \n  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert\n  denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not\n  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after\n  the date.\n      British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs\n  worth of debentures.\n      The suit also alleges that management, the board of\n  directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of\n  entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston\n  Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,\n  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible\n  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase\n  program and the manner in which its financing has been\n  structured.\n  \n\n",

        "DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY\n  A cut of about half a percentage point\n  in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although\n  economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.\n      Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,\n  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide\n  premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,\n  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.\n      Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances\n  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its\n  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.\n      That rate has remained in force, just holding above the\n  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial\n  bank borrowings.\n      Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German\n  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,\n  forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.\n      In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to\n  three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money\n  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans\n  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.\n      Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance\n  Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.\n      In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he\n  would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance\n  Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion\n  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct\n  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.\n      Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference\n  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under\n  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add\n  extra liquidity to the money market.\n      Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to\n  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would\n  result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,\n  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.\n      The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its\n  parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673\n  guilders per 100 marks.\n      Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10\n  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level\n  that would not permit a change in the interest rate\n  differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers\n  said.\n      An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and\n  Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he\n  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\n  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\n  in the longer term.\n      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\n  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\n  point to a falling rate of economic growth.\n      \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\n  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\n  the ABN economist said.\n      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\n  January, could also contribute to some inflation.\n      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\n  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\n  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\n  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\n  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\n  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\n  five pct.\n      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\n  the money market.\n  \n\n",

        "COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM\n  Computer Associates International Inc's\n  800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its\n  strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition\n  from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street\n  analysts said.\n       \"IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems\n  software,\" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\n  and Jenrette.\n      \"But the combination of the two companies will clearly\n  present a much stronger front,\" he said.\n      Besides IBM, \"Computer Associates will be far and away the\n  most powerful company in the field,\" added E.F. Hutton analyst\n  Terence Quinn.\n      That field is a segment of the market known as system\n  utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of\n  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,\n  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.\n      The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the\n  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.\n  Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that\n  will find the competition much harder than in the past.\n      For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a\n  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,\n  N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.\n      When the deal is completed sometime in August, the\n  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past \n  Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent\n  software vendor.\n      Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang\n  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\n  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\n  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\n  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\n  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\n  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\n  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\n  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\n  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\n  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n  56 cts a share.\n     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\n  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer\n  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\n  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\n  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services\n  unit.\n      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\n  news conference that the merger would give computer users a\n  single source for a wide range of software products.\n      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\n  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\n  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has\n  been successful with accounting and banking systems.\n      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\n  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\n  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\n  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\n  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\n  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\n  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\n  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\n  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\n  dlrs a share.\n      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\n  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\n  and research and development.\n      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\n  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\n  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\n  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times\n  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\n  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n  \n      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\n  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\n  owns 58 pct of Uccel.\n      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\n  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\n  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\n  Department.\n      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\n  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n  \n\n",

        "LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS\n  The elimination of limits on daily price\n  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the\n  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect\n  on the market, analysts said.\n      \"There is nothing apparent from the change,\" said William\n  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.\n      \"The market has not approached the old price limits and\n  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,\" he said.\n      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two\n  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper\n  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,\n  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver\n  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting\n  of all daily limits, effective today.\n      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per\n  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the\n  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.\n      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back\n  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby\n  contracts amid quiet trading today.\n      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded\n  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the\n  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or\n  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.\n      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many\n  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.\n      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs\n  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.\n      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,\n  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic\n  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.\n      O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would\n  add caution to trading.\n      \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals\n  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\"\n  O'Neill said.\n  \n\n",

        "TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET\n  European free market tin traders made a\n  somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur\n  dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.\n      Traders said the new market would probably be a useful\n  trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin\n  interests although European traders generally appear to be\n  reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system\n  which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin\n  trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to\n  see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and\n  what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.\n      There is also a view among European traders that, while the\n  proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another\n  useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian\n  government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by\n  the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.\n      Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of\n  trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while\n  there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject\n  a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court\n  litigation actions have been resolved.\n      Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently\n  around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse\n  Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten\n  year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as\n  4,680 stg in December 1986.\n      This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading\n  ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350\n  stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.\n      LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065\n  tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485\n  tonnes reached in February 1986.\n      Traders said the free market turned bullish during late\n  last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand\n  deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting\n  prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\n      However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\n  in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\n  4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\n      The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\n  little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\n      There was also a lack of significant demand from major\n  steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\n      Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\n  holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\n  and the bulk of material still available is being held by\n  Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\n  market with unwanted metal.\n      Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\n  International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\n  support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\n  nations of the International Tin Agreement.\n      The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\n  having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\n  position.\n      Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\n  prices and movements are still expected to be largely related\n  to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\n  emerges for the third quarter.\n      The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\n  efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\n  prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\n  export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\n  major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\n  apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\n  consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.\n  \n\n",

        "MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS\n  Flooding in the Red River on the\n  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a\n  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per\n  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a\n  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.\n      \"The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any\n  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility\n  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,\" a company\n  source said.\n      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and\n  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.\n      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is\n  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring\n  oil which has been lost to the flood.\n      \"But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be\n  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like\n  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.\"\n      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield\n  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell\n  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's\n  operator.\n       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude\n  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to\n  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.\n      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to\n  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.\n      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of\n  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.\n      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline\n  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West\n  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a\n  barrel below WTI, respectively.\n      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at\n  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days\n  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River\n  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is\n  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area\n  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.\n      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was\n  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.\n  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil\n  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was\n  apparently washed away.\n     \n      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed\n  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this\n  line.\n      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not\n  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,\n  which is nearby.\n  \n\n",

On the other hand, does\n  Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it\n  and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?\"\n      \"It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,\" said\n  analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a\n  Minneapolis brokerage. \"Electronics retailing is very management\n  concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in\n  place.\"\n      Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already\n  owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may\n  be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its\n  7-dlr-a-share offer.\n      Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high\n  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was\n  announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share\n  in over-the- counter trading. \n      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York\n  City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that\n  his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.\n      A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken\n  no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs\n  since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He\n  would not comment on the new offer.\n      Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as\n  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to\n  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to\n  consumers by cable television.\n      In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to\n  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit\n  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.\n      Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,\n  Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in\n  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase\n  of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to\n  assist in financing the balance.\n      Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to\n  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since\n  Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same\n  amount.\n      Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday\n  to 9.50.\n  \n\n",

A preliminary\n  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until\n  the case is decided.\n      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr\n  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share\n  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens\n  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens\n  offer.\n      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and\n  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about\n  the company in making their takeover attempt.\n   \n      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James\n  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber\n  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23\n  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's\n  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,\n  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to\n  divulge inside information about the company.\n      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began\n  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\n  \"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its\n  management,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.\n      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from\n  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information\n  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or\n  Burlington's public financial statements.\n      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with\n  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with\n  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went\n  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.\n  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a\n  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in\n  February.\n      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held\n  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as\n  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off\n  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and\n  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide\n  inside information.\n      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen\n  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman\n  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and\n  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an\n  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.\n      \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the\n  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for\n  those who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington\n  lawyer Humphrey.\n      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the\n  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in\n  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's\n  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants\n  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,\n  the lawyers said.\n      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the\n  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends\n  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light\n  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price\n  dictate.\n      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by\n  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid\n  for Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose\n  would have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,\n  a Samjens lawyer.\n  \n\n",

        "U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND\n  The dollar's recent signs of stability\n  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,\n  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until\n  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.\n      \"The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the\n  dollar has bottomed out,\" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.\n      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value\n  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially\n  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on\n  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.\n      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen\n  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,\n  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.\n      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far\n  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.\n      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March\n  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued\n  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.\n      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if\n  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up\n  towards 150 yen.\n      \"There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed\n  out for the medium term,\" added Tom Campbell of First National\n  Bank of Chicago.\n      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing\n  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would\n  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's\n  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and \n  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.\n      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen\n  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central\n  bank intervention to support the dollar.\n      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that\n  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion\n  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount\n  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.\n      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention\n  volume as \"impressive\".\n      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,\n  however: \"the dollar has not yet bottomed out.

ETL is classified as\n  foreign because of its New Zealand base.\n      The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28\n  mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.\n      Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the\n  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the\n  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the\n  diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.\n      ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance\n  conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment\n  and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.\n      ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the\n  shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.\n      ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have\n  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion\n  and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.\n      Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement\n  that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend\n  acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.\n      He also said Monier will not now proceed with the\n  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on\n  March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.\n      As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex\n  put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,\n  Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of\n  accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to\n  50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.\n      CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland\n  taking the second option, resulting in the two companies\n  running Monier as a joint venture.\n      CSR officials have also said they had no intention of\n  raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention\n  became public last week.\n  \n\n",
        "VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS\n  Venezuela's central bank has ordered\n  Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange\n  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to\n  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.\n      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has\n  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's\n  volatile currency market.\n      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez\n  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international\n  operations.\n      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign\n  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign\n  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign\n  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.\n      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied\n  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to\n  prop up the weakening bolivar.\n      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de\n  facto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense\n  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker\n  here said.\n      \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction\n  is towards complete control,\" the broker said.\n      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his\n  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since\n  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with\n  telephone calls.\n      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume\n  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs\n  a day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he\n  said.\n      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the\n  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary\n  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.\n      \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's\n  ridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against\n  foreigners.\"\n      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central\n  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange\n  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct\n  reserve requirement.\n      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in\n  bolivar futures, the broker said.\n      \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small\n  currency it was miraculous.\"\n      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.\n  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range\n  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running\n  out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free\n  market.\n  \n\n",

        "NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER\n  Bundesbank vice president Helmut\n  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.\n      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in\n  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,\n  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a\n  further cut in interest rates was needed.\n      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a\n  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from\n  the fourth, he added. \"We may have an increase in gnp starting\n  in the second quarter,\" he said in an interview.\n      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been\n  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its\n  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.\n      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was\n  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in\n  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.\n      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole\n  would probably be between one and two pct.\n     \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic\n  demand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest\n  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.\n      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money\n  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace\n  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six\n  pct target.\n      He said the target could still be achieved but much will\n  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy\n  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS\n  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.\n      \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of\n  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit\n  reversed,\" Schlesinger said.\n      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction\n  that the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market,\n  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have\n  diminished,\" Schlesinger said.\n      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the\n  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period\n  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined\n  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.\n      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar\n  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87\n  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.\n      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.\n      \"Central banks are always in contact about these\n  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\"\n  Schelsinger said.\n      \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said,\n  adding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American\n  case.\"\n      He said that the West German export industry has been hit\n  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see\n  some correction now. \"But it wouldn't be good to have short-term\n  fluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"\n      \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very\n  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level\n  (of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.\n      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of\n  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West\n  German inflation down year.\n      Although there have recently been signs of inflation\n  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key\n  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would\n  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.\n      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth\n  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the\n  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.\n      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16\n  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of\n  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the\n  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.\n      But he added: \"I don't see any great pressure to go away\n  from it.\"\n  \n\n",
        "JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS\n  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could\n  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into\n  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.\n      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review\n  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of\n  International Trade and Industry (MITI).\n      A spokesman for a major firm said, \"Deregulation would bring\n  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer\n  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.\"\n      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.\n      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it\n  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It\n  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of\n  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and\n  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.\n      They said deregulation was vital to promote more\n  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.\n      \"Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn\n  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,\" said a source\n  at one major Japanese oil company.\n      A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, \"We'll have a hard\n  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.\"\n      \"In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for\n  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out\n  further into other lines such as real estate and travel\n  agencies,\" he said.\n      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd\n  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the\n  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining\n  capacity in fiscal 1986.\n      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products\n  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a\n  spokesman for the company said.\n      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the\n  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies\n  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the\n  efficiency of the industry.\n      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to\n  be streamlined further into five refining groups.\n      \"MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to\n  merge into five to build up their muscles,\" a source said.\n      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the\n  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry\n  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.\n      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the\n  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but\n  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards\n  deregulation.\n  \n\n",

        "CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET\n  The Philippines' first quarter growth\n  figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely\n  to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose\n  Fernandez said in an interview.\n      The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)\n  announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct\n  and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter\n  from a year earlier.\n      \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it\n  (growth) short,\" Fernandez said.\n       NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the\n  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP\n  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.\n      \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources\n  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that\n  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and\n  would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.\n      \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at\n  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,\n  showed that the economy was on a different track from last\n  year,\" he said.\n      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the\n  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it\n  could drop off in the third quarter.\n      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the\n  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in\n  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.\n      \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.\n      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for\n  the first quarter in consultation with the International\n  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth\n  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.\n      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling\n  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.\n  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or\n  August to review performance in the January-June period.\n      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion\n  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.\n  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their\n  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.\n      \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA\n  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial\n  banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.\n      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF\n  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.\n      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28\n  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.\n      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984\n  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in\n  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in\n  October last year, had almost been completed.\n      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level\n  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\n  \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.\n      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I\n  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own\n  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap\n  forward as might have been suitable.\"\n      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach\n  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.\n      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first\n  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.\n      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of\n  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while\n  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.\n      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some\n  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the\n  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more\n  competitive.\n      \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso\n  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's\n  trading partners,\" he said.\n      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was\n  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted\n  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two\n  years after the imposition of the Code.\n      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has\n  been delayed by objections from some business groups.\n      \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the\n  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be\n  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds\n  and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.\n      \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of\n  capital and earnings can be free,\" he said.\n      \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly\n  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external\n  availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"\n  \n\n",

But year-on-year growth is expected to\n  be about two pct.\n      Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to\n  cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,\n  at three pct, is just above historical lows.\n      West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice\n  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,\n  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered\n  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over\n  two years.\n      The government has pointed out that depressed exports are\n  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but\n  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will\n  compensate for this setback.\n      It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under\n  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.\n  \n\n",

        "POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK\n  For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is\n  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has\n  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for\n  the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the\n  mark.\n      President of the powerful and independent West German\n  central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his\n  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the\n  end of this year, government officials say.\n      (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)\n      But no official announcement has yet been made, raising\n  eyebrows in West Germany's business community.\n      The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top\n  ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in\n  opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.\n      There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl\n  would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own\n  Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked\n  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\n  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\n  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\n  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\n  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\n  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\n  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\n  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\n  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\n  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\n  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\n  of galloping inflation this century.\n      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\n  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\n  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\n  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n      \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\n  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\n  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\n  would endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\n  journalists in Frankfurt recently.\n      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\n  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n      \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\n  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\n  economy,\" she said.\n      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\n  identified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\n  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\n  rigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\n  persuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\n  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\n  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\n  currencies.\n      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\n  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\n  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n      \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\n  don't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\n  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\n  round, making a speculator's position worthless.\n      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\n  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\n  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\n  play golf.\n      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\n  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n      \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\n  if you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\n  are very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\n  many people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\n  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.\n  \n\n",

        "CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS\n  China will not increase sugar imports\n  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints\n  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising\n  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.\n      \"Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the\n  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to\n  be extremely serious,\" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986\n  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because\n  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical\n  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.\n      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop\n  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year\n  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.\n      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500\n  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier\n  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China\n  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.\n      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province\n  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the\n  area under sugar was dropping.\n      \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper\n  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of\n  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane\n  is a major problem.\"\n      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,\n  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in\n  area planted.\n      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel\n  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the\n  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.\n      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province\n  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667\n  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only\n  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.\n      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to\n  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.\n      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed\n  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in\n  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.\n      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the\n  official press has said.\n      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of\n  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.\n      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln\n  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.\n      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks\n  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import\n  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986\n  when the central government resumed control of imports.\n      \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored\n  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat\n  said.\n      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to\n  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly\n  as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is\n  one factor determining import levels,\" he said.\n      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,\n  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.\n      \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about\n  152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer\n  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into\n  the open market.\"\n      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding\n  imports was price.\n      \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,\n  foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said.\n      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five\n  pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better\n  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the\n  foreign exchange situation demands it.\"\n  \n\n",

        "U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT\n  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.\n  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a\n  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11\n  general election, market analysts said.\n      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected\n  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.\n      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now\n  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb\n  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the\n  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.\n      \"We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than\n  we have done hitherto,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\n  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the\n  record reserves rise.\n      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre\n  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the\n  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign\n  exchanges. \"We have been playing a very full part ourselves,\" he\n  said.\n      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on\n  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down\n  its rise, more in the light of local factors.\n      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,\n  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain\n  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last\n  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.\n      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign\n  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as\n  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably\n  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.\n      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower\n  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse\n  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.\n      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves\n  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of\n  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0\n  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.\n      \"The market doesn't want to do anything because of the\n  election,\" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.\n      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of\n  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had\n  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to\n  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the\n  forward market.\n      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of\n  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth\n  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention\n  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.\n      The key three months interbank money market rates eased\n  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend\n  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves\n  news, analysts said.\n      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was\n  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of\n  another huge rise in reserves, they added.\n      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut\n  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so\n  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove\n  accurate, with another half point later.\n      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse\n  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be\n  possible. \"Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in\n  future, rather than this active intervention,\" he predicted.\n      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned\n  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut\n  looked likely.\n      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.\n      \"The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political\n  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And\n  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),\" said Robin\n  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.\n      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in\n  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the\n  European Monetary System.\n      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10\n  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did\n  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.\n  \n\n",

        "S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET\n  South Africa is expected to unveil\n  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year\n  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,\n  economic analysts said.\n      Faced with competing demands for increased military and\n  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black\n  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is\n  expected to raise significantly the government's overall\n  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,\n  the analysts said.\n      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state\n  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the\n  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas\n  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.\n      \"Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but\n  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget\n  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,\" said Rob Lee,\n  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.\n      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted\n  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of\n  less than one pct.\n      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5\n  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to\n  over 30 pct.\n      Economists estimate that the government's spending target\n  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at\n  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit\n  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\n  GDP.\n      The government, having consistently overshot its own\n  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\n  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\n  budget, analysts said.\n      \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"\n  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\n      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\n  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\n  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\n  money and capital markets.\n      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending\n  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\n  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\n  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\n  IMF.\n      \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted\n  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\n  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\n  two years.\n      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\n  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis\n  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\n  loans to the country in September 1985.\n      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\n  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\n  government officials say economic growth is the prime\n  objective.\n      But private-sector economists caution that the government's\n  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\n  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\n  current account of the country's balance of payments.\n      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\n  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\n  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\n  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international\n  creditor banks.\n      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\n  little room to manoeuvre.\n      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\n  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\n  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax\n  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\n      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\n  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\n  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.\n      \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry\n  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive\n  Federal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the\n  sweets were given out before the election.\"\n  \n\n",

        "LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY\n  The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven\n  finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies\n  has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the\n  economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the\n  Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.\n      Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce\n  any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work\n  remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting\n  world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.\n  \n      \"I think it is possible that there may be scope for a\n  further reduction in interest rates in Germany,\" he added, but\n  stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was\n  likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\n      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction\n  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"\n      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\n  \"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy\n  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\n  he was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate.\n      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\n  currency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing\n  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\n  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"\n      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\n  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\n  commitments underlying the accord.\n      \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\n  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\n  commitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.\n  Budget deficit was \"very important.\"\n      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\n  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\n  said, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\n  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"\n      \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\n  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\n  wholly unjustified,\" he said.\n      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan\n  bashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\n  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\n  Japanese development aid over the next three years.\n      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\n  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\n      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\n  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\n  jack up faltering economic growth.\n      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\n  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\n  scheduled for 1990.

        "CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER\n  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with\n  its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd\n  &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>\n  (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.\n      ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's\n  issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.\n  This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed\n  bid.\n      The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand\n  entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct\n  stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.\n  \n      Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds\n  just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and\n  had told CSR it is not a seller.\n      He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its\n  operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up\n  a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.\n      The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with\n  Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six\n  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the\n  same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.\n      CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.\n  \n      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond\n  describing it as a long term investment.\n      ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is\n  a leader in building materials, Herbert said.\n      \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.\n      CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its\n  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves\n  into energy several years ago.\n      Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert\n  said: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to\n  wonder if Monier is the main target.\"\n  \n      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a\n  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.\n      Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its\n  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.\n      The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on\n  yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign\n  shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review\n  Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.\n      Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely\n  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge\n  the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.\n  \n      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible\n  acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a\n  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the\n  negotiations foundered on the price.\n      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not\n  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid\n  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.\n      \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of\n  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having\n  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.\n      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.\n  \n\n",

        "BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY\n  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change\n  credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\n  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking\n  economists and money market dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\n  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\n  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\n  in the near future, they said.\n      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\n  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\n      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\n  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\n  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.\n      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\n  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\n  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\n  stable against the mark.\n      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\n  opened a representative office, that the West German economy\n  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\n  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\n      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\n  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\n  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\n  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\n      \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\n  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\n  Lombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\n  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\n  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\n  around historical lows for West Germany.\n      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\n  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\n  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\n      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\n  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\n  \"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.\n      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\n  line with the new structure of money market rates since last\n  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\n      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\n  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\n      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\n  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"\n      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\n  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\n  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\n      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\n  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\n  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\n      \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\n  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"\n  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\n      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\n  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I\n  don't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.\n      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\n  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\n  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\n  month-end distortions.\n      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\n  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\n  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\n  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.\n      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\n  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\n  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\n  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\n      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\n  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not\n  represent a tightening of policy, however.\n      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\n  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\n  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\n  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\n  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\n  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\n  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French\n  occupation this century.\n      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\n  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\n  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\n  treated for minimum reserve purposes.\n  \n\n",

Traders said that\n  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the\n  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.\n      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be\n  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil\n  prices, the analysts said.\n      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports\n  continue at relatively high levels.\n      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln\n  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.\n      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who\n  looks for a build said, \"We have had five weeks of gasoline\n  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to\n  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand\n  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,\" he added.\n      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw\n  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.\n     \n      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest\n  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline\n  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.\n      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to\n  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3\n  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.\n      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add\n  to U.S. stocks.\n      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery\n  runs.\n      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between\n  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level\n  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was\n  discounted as having a market impact at this time.\n      \"A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,\"\n  one futures analyst said.\n      Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build\n  between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels\n  reported by API for the week of may 22.\n      The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added\n  to the nation's inventory.\n  \n\n",

Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly\n  deal, he added.\n      \"We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or\n  about a perfume company,\" he said. \"We want a good basic\n  industrial company that will fit into our management\n  structure,\" Durham said.\n     \n      During the interview, Durham and other executives also said\n  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to\n  higher prices for the metal.\n      \"In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price\n  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new\n  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,\n  will continue to grow modestly,\" said executive vice president\n  Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of\n  producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50\n  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and\n  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.\n      Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now\n  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts\n  said.\n      Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been\n  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.\n      He declined to project results for the second quarter or\n  year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in\n  copper prices in the last month will help results.\n      Durham said last month that the second quarter should match\n  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln\n  dlrs or 49 cts a share.\n      First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,\n  reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased\n  copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also\n  acquired last year.\n      Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75\n  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.\n  \n\n",

        "BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS\n  U.S. House and Senate budget\n  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached\n  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending\n  on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.\n      The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4\n  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.\n      The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the\n  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a\n  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.\n      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture\n  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in\n  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets\n  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior\n  Congressional aides told Reuters.\n      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find\n  the budget savings.\n      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\n  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\n  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\n  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\n  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\n  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\n  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\n  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\n  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\n  savings Glickman claims.\n      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\n  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\n  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\n  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\n  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\n  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\n  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\n  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\n  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\n  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\n  unfair to one commodity.\n      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\n  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some\n  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \n  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\n  but not enough, they said.\n      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\n  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\n  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\n  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\n  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\n  \n\n",

        "OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS\n  Some OPEC states are unhappy about the\n  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\n  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\n  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\n      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\n  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\n  about price differentials making some of their crudes\n  uncompetitive.\n      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\n  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\n  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\n      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\n  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\n  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\n      \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\n  differentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But\n  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well\n  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"\n      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\n  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\n  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\n  marketing incentives have helped their sales.\n      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\n  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\n  better priced grades in a \"package.\"\n      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\n  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\n  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\n  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\n  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\n  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\n  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\n  when members offered discounts to attract customers.\n      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\n  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\n  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\n  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\n  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\n  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\n  analysts say.\n      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\n  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\n  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\n  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\n  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\n  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\n  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing\n  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\n  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\n  pay the new prices.\n     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\n  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\n  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\n  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\n  risen.\n      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\n  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\n  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\n  differentials question in Vienna.\n      \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\n  holds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n  \n\n",
        "NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE\n  Analysts said they were surprised at\n  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for\n  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy\n  statements and positive for the economy.\n      Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus\n  for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs\n  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.\n      Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus\n  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'\n  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.\n      Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters\n  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a\n  2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.\n      The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and\n  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,\n  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite\n  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more\n  confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.\n      However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying\n  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will\n  move lower.\n      The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after\n  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget\n  release.\n      Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share\n  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company\n  taxation to revenue figures.\n      One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus\n  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points\n  tomorrow.\n      The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a\n  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of\n  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively\n  by overseas investors, another said.\n      But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax\n  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share\n  market, particularly multi-national companies.\n      The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,\n  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The\n  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln\n  N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.\n      Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and\n  there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another\n  economist said.

        "U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS\n  Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed\n  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current\n  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.\n      A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing\n  production data showed that the economy is still strong and\n  does not need a fillip from lower rates.\n      News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,\n  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money\n  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist\n  arguments against easier credit, they said.\n      \"The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back\n  all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money\n  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near\n  term,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.\n      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's\n  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies\n  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.\n  Rates.\n      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that\n  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such\n  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which\n  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's\n  strength.\n      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm\n  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment\n  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly\n  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying\n  average earnings in April, dealers said.\n      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending\n  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank\n  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset\n  the impact on domestic money supply of its current\n  intervention.\n      \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin,\n  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.\n      \"That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very\n  good state indeed,\" Skeoch said.\n      \"There's no reason to get worries about inflationary\n  pressures because they're very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises\n  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to\n  April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings\n  which were potentially inflationary, he added.\n      \"I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major\n  problem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.\n      But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried\n  about the funding implications of recent intervention.\n      He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets\n  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that\n  the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now\n  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try\n  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.\n      However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson\n  Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still\n  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal\n  higher inflation this year.\n      \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As\n  long as that continues we're okay,\" he added.\n  \n\n",

        "EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX\n  A spokesman for the European\n  Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy\n  on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help\n  alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.\n      Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's\n  Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils\n  and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the\n  sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in\n  the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to\n  make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem\n  within that sector by paying a levy.\"\n      The proposed tax is necessary because the level of\n  budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds\n  production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.\n      Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European\n  Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0\n  billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"\n  agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\n  feel the full impact of its enlargement.\n      The Commission has proposed several cost and production\n  cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\n  guaranteed quantity system, he added.\n      Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\n  prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\n  Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\n  said.\n      Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\n  amount when market prices are below or above this level.\n      He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\n  amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\n  Policy's oils and fats regime.\n      \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\n  proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\n  or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.\n      Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\n  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\n      It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\n  to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\n  it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\n      EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\n  under present aid arrangements, he said.\n      The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\n  produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\n  imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\n  Tanghe said.\n      The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\n  requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\n  effect would stabilise Community production levels without\n  affecting demand, he said.\n      It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\n  import levels, he said.\n      Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\n  imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\n  requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\n  Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\n  beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\n  \n\n",

        "ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT\n  Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping\n  to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a\n  year in the next few years despite low world prices,\n  deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry\n  officials said.\n      But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough\n  International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has\n  introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure\n  the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.\n      Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia\n  Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year\n  ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a\n  record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.\n      \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial\n  year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due\n  to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM\n  official said.\n      ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another\n  strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.\n      Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes\n  higher than the previous year and the best production achieved\n  to date.\n      Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper\n  industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining\n  is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\n  country's foreign exchange earnings.\n      Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\n  by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\n  spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\n  last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n      A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\n  by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\n  Development Bank and the World Bank.\n      The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\n  metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n      ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\n  said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\n  part of the plan.\n      More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\n  industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\n  the five-year restructuring plan.\n      Company officials said although reserves were being\n  depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\n  end of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n      Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\n  the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\n  kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\n  levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n      ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\n  with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n      Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n  1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\n  the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\n  two to the dollar.\n      But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\n  auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\n  and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\n  strategy based on national resources.\n      ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\n  break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n      \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\n  affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\n  under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\n  and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n      Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\n  rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\n  profits.\n      \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\n  point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\n  Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n      High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\n  industry.\n      Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\n  cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\n  and under 40 cents in Chile.\n      The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\n  being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\n  stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n      Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\n  sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n  5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\n  Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\n  fuel.\n  \n\n",

        "BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING\n  A trade-led boom in the U.S. is\n  unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will\n  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and\n  other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its\n  latest economic report.\n      Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,\n  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will\n  contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.\n      As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5\n  pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,\n  the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.\n      \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop\n  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause\n  a falloff in the growth of disposable income,\" Van Dyke said.\n      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8\n  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.\n      The report was released before the Commerce Department\n  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,\n  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal\n  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with\n  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.\n      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost\n  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9\n  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.\n      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income \n  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.\n      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power\n  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs\n  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.\n      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing\n  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in\n  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.\n      \"For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988\n  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,\" Van Dyke said.\n      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an\n  improvement in trade. \"However, with protectionist attitudes on\n  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,\" he\n  added.\n  \n\n",
        "BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE\n  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas\n  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of\n  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to\n  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.\n      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the\n  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or\n  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot\n  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,\n  analysts said.\n      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing\n  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South\n  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has\n  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.\n       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs\n  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas\n  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.\n      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open\n  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear\n  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.\n      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for\n  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.\n      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of\n  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a\n  Brooklyn Union official said.\n      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\n  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through\n  to rate payers.\n      While net effect on the company will not be known for\n  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,\n  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,\n  will end up paying more for gas, he said.\n      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas\n  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be\n  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\n  Jenrette, said.\n      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high\n  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.\n      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for\n  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,\n  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost\n  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with\n  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering\n  firm, said.\n      \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the\n  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said.\n      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request\n  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility\n  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.\n      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will\n  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to\n  alternative fuels, he said.\n      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the\n  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being\n  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.\n      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas\n  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory\n  on the inventory charge, he said.\n      \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may\n  take a while.\"\n  \n\n",

        "GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR\n  Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group\n  Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette\n  Co that could draw some big international players and in the\n  process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts\n  said.\n      Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of\n  directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested\n  consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per\n  share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\n  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n      \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\n  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\n  to make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\n  Lehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\n  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\n  takeover target.\n      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\n  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\n  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\n  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\n  three yesterday.\n      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\n  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\n  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\n  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\n  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\n  returned telephone calls seeking comment.\n      \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\n  someone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\n  Merrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\n  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\n  dlrs per share.\"\n      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\n  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\n  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\n  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\n  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\n  operations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\n  the dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\n  has recently made two other acquisitions.\n      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\n  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\n  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\n  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,\n  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston\n  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.\n      \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\n  Wall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\n  company is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\n  to resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\n  consenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\n  said.\n     \n      Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n  \"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\n  calculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to\n  be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\n  shareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\n  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\n  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\n  agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank\n  N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial\n  adviser.\n  \n\n",

Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his\n  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.\n  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they\n  approve of the proposal.\n      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per\n  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for\n  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on\n  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs\n  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.\n      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market\n  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting\n  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the\n  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings\n  examining farm programs.\n      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his\n  \"Family Farm Act.\"\n      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income\n  and reduce government spending on agriculture.\n      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not\n  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would\n  increase overall revenue from exports.\n      This would be done by seeking agreement among major\n  exporting countries including the European Community on market\n  sharing at agreed high prices.\n      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing\n  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.\n      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports\n  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices\n  stem more from \"gouging\" by food processing companies than from\n  high farm product prices.\n      Harkin cited what he termed \"excessive\" net returns on\n  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct\n  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.\n  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct\n  Quaker Oats.\n      -- Harkin said a \"legitimate\" concern about his bill would\n  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.\n      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would\n  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.\n  grain stocks for three years.\n      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a\n  \"predictable and stable\" grain price, he said.\n      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm\n  participation would be no more \"mandatory\" than the current\n  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm\n  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect\n  farm income.\n  \n\n",

        "OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND\n  West German economic growth will slow to\n  1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic\n  demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation\n  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its\n  semi-annual review of the world economy.\n      This view is less favourable than the West German\n  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this\n  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic\n  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.\n      The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,\n  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real\n  terms.\n      The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing\n  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some\n  recovery in business confidence in the near future.\n      But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy\n  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by\n  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.\n      While noting that the government is bringing forward a five\n  billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that \"the\n  medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy\n  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow\n  relatively lower tax rates.\"\n      Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal\n  Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP\n  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of\n  this year compared with the final three months of 1986.\n      Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared\n  likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of\n  the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.\n      West Germany's current account surplus, the target of\n  considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is\n  expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from\n  35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in\n  1988.\n  \n\n",

        "JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD\n  Japan's trade surplus is likely to\n  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad\n  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the\n  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\n  said.\n      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the\n  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last\n  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while\n  export markets rose by only two pct.\n      But it said this differential between the growth of\n  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,\n  \"thus weakening the international adjustment process.\"\n      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two\n  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct\n  in 1988.

However, OECD officials said the\n  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite\n  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have\n  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.\n      The OECD outlook said, \"Continued large current account\n  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial\n  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure\n  on the yen.\" It said that further appreciation could then lead\n  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus\n  weaken domestic growth.\n      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to\n  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct\n  growth.

        "FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY\n  New U.S. Banking data suggest the\n  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path\n  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists\n  said.\n      But they also said that if money supply growth remains\n  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline\n  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its\n  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary\n  policy.\n      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a\n  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June\n  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a\n  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\n  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\n  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\n  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\n  economists said.\n      \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan\n  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\n  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\n  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\n  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\n  as better gauges of economic growth.\n      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\n  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\n  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\n      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\n  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\n  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\n      \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\n  market position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end\n  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"\n      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings\n  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period\n  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had\n  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.\n      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day\n  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher\n  borrowings target would probably have been reached.\n      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in\n  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,\n  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has\n  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.\n      \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed\n  easing at some point,\" he said.\n      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little\n  attention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of\n  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the\n  economy,\" one said. \"I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is\n  falling apart and the Fed should ease.\"\n      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a\n  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary\n  policy.\n      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates\n  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and\n  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke\n  off econmomic growth.\n      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late\n  April. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a\n  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives\n  them more room to ease,\" he said.\n  \n\n",

        "TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY\n  Recent government moves to curb capital\n  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's\n  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar\n  against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.\n      Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the\n  reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two\n  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the\n  U.S. Dollar.\n      Chang said, \"The pace of increase in our reserves is much\n  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.\"\n  He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus\n  with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.\n  Dlrs a month between January and May.\n      The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and\n  West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.\n      On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of\n  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank\n  purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90\n  pct of the value of a contract.\n      Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had\n  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to\n  importers and exporters.\n      They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar\n  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks\n  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.\n      Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against\n  the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese\n  cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five\n  to eight cents in May.\n      The bank dealers said the central bank, which had\n  previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1\n  billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial\n  demand.\n      They said they expected the government to keep the local\n  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to\n  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of\n  more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since\n  September 1985.\n      The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,\n  unchanged from yesterday.\n      Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,\n  \"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow\n  is quite successful.\"\n      Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower\n  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from\n  Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.\n      Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed\n  imports of machinery and production equipment because of\n  exchange rate uncertainty, he said.

        "U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES\n  More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers\n  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes\n  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other\n  interest rates.\n      And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in\n  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers\n  trying to lock into cheap money.\n      The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials\n  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home\n  mortgage business.\n      While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They\n  were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a\n  few years ago.\n      But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,\n  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\n  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\n  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\n  induce them to retain their accounts.\n      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\n  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\n  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n      \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\n  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\n  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\n  offering variable rate mortgages.\n      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\n  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\n  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still\n  more.\n      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\n  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\n  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\n  new business, officials at all three institutions said.\n      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\n  below those on the variable rate loans.\n      \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\n  rate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\n  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\n  new mortgage loans.\n      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\n  loans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\n  mortgage product.\"\n      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\n  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\n  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n      \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\n  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\n  of its 1986 volume.\n      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\n  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\n  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\n  lender is earning an above average return on assets.\n      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\n  the benefit of cheap money.\n      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\n  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\n  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\n  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n      Young explained that the company had planned to protect\n  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\n  complicated hedging instrument.\n      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\n  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\n  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the\n  mortgages and hedge profitably.\n      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\n  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\n  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\n  and selling them to an investor.\n      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\n  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\n  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\n  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\n  over the past few years.\n  \n\n",

At that point, barring any increased\n  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\n  should begin easing.\n      \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\n  to in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\n  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\n  barrels in the fourth quarter.\n      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\n  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\n  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\n  reduction in output.\n      \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\n  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\n  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\n  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\n  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n      \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\n  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\n  committed to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\n  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\n  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\n  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\n  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\n  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\n  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\n  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\n  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\n  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\n  producers receive less money for their oil.\n      \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\n  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n      \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\n  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\n  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\n  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\n  said.\n      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n      \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\n  Gulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\n  Securites.\n      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\n  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\n  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\n  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n      \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\n  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\n  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.\n  \n\n",

        "EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA\n  European coffee roasters and traders\n  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating\n  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee\n  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.\n      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee\n  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.\n      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and\n  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an\n  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current\n  coffee agreement, van Horick said.\n      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the\n  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new\n  agreement, van Horick said.\n      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when\n  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in\n  Brazil.\n      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and\n  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.\n      \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the\n  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal\n  leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.\n      \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\n  reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula\n  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\n  everyone.\"\n      Although full implications of the new formula have still to\n  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\n  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\n  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\n  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\n      Because the proposal provides that future quota\n  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\n  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\n  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\n      \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\n  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\n  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\n  new quota formula, \" van Horick said.\n      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\n      \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If\n  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two\n  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might\n  just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.\n  \n\n",

        "NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA\n  President Reagan's nominee as top\n  policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an\n  agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock\n  price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the\n  globalization of financial markets.\n      David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at\n  Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday\n  to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and\n  Exchange Commission.\n      If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed\n  John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record\n  six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.\n      The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its\n  investigators have probed into the most colossal insider\n  trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.\n      The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in\n  recent months as a growing number of well known traders and\n  prominent investment banking firms have been charged with\n  wrongdoing.\n      The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after\n  Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock\n  speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators\n  and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal\n  profits after being charged with insider trading.\n      But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new\n  phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by\n  computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in \n  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have\n  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\n  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\n  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\n  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\n  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\n  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\n  for an international securities marketplace in which trading\n  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\n  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\n  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\n  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\n  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\n  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\n  review of hostile corporate takeovers.\n      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\n  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\n  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n      In line with the views of other top administration\n  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\n  battles over new federal regulations.\n      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\n  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\n  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\n  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\n  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\n  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\n  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\n  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\n  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n      The agency is one of the few in the government that\n  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\n  few years because of fees it charges public companies,\n  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\n  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\n  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\n  for policy differences alone.\n      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\n  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\n  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\n  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\n  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\n  market manipulations by large investment firms.\n      The agency requires public companies and investment\n  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\n  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their\n  condition any time they issue new securities.\n      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\n  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\n  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\n  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\n  become the nation's 35th president.\n      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\n  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\n  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central\n  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n  \n\n",
        "U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES\n  The Administration asked Congress to\n  replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it\n  into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade\n  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.\n      The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more\n  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when\n  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.\n      Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is\n  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet\n  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they\n  should pay about the same rates of duties.\n      Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to\n  deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of\n  differing systems which they now face.\"\n      He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational\n  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.\n      Yeutter said government and business moves are based on\n  data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve\n  knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.\n      He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under\n  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by\n  January 1988.\n  \n\n",

The problem grew severe as\n  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.\n      Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that\n  Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to\n  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.\n      But Tenneco today said open access \"is one of the steps\n  FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC\n  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even\n  before all transitional problems are solved.\"\n      A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure\n  under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure\n  for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from\n  Louisiana and Texas up to New England.\n      \"We remain convinced that the most critical transitional\n  issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by\n  FERC in the near future.\n      \"A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the\n  industry's continued ability to provide its customers with\n  reliable natural gas,\" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co\n  president R.C.

        "U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS\n  The economy faces lackluster growth\n  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement\n  in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.\n      Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness\n  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further\n  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.\n      \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength\n  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle\n  Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers\n  Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.\n      The Commerce Department said this week that the economy\n  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but\n  a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.\n      Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending\n  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.\n      \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --\n  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \"\n  Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,\n  told Reuters.\n      Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow\n  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.\n      To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,\n  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost\n  personal income and consumption, he says.\n      \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to\n  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\"\n  Gramley said.\n      Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters\n  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the\n  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last\n  and said the recovery was showing anemia.\n      Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace\n  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into\n  monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be\n  accommodative.\n      Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct\n  forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if\n  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add\n  to the risk of a recession.\n      Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May\n  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an\n  inventory overhang still exists.\n      He says the boost in production came from smaller\n  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have\n  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.\n      \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in\n  economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a\n  recession,\" Mauro said.\n      In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl\n  Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the\n  trade deficit will continue to improve.\n      \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and\n  into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.\n      But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in\n  inflation.\n      Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers\n  Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5\n  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after\n  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.\n      The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil\n  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.\n      \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets\n  out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he\n  would like the Fed to tighten credit.\n      A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the\n  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says\n  a prominent international banker.\n      Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National\n  Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and\n  the mark will continue for years because the United States is\n  the world's largest debtor nation.\n      The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a\n  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that\n  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.\n  \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.\n  \n\n",

September\n  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93\n  in mid-June, Duggan said.\n      While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,\n  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through\n  chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted\n  above the 93 level.\n      \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken\n  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range\n  market,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst\n  Brian Singer said.\n      The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.\n  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.\n      \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value\n  of the dollar,\" Kahan said.\n      Additional influences next week will be possible\n  developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact\n  and size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not\n  be in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said.\n      In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding\n  auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and\n  Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results\n  with little excitement.

Has ensured\n  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in\n  effect putting pressure on end-users,\" a European crude oil\n  trader said.\n      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, \"There's no reason to expect\n  a weak market from now on.\"\n      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, \"We\n  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter\n  production so the market will react very bullishly.\"\n      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a\n  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark\n  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.\n      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at\n  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still\n  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.\n      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu\n  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak\n  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders\n  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.\n      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to\n  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.\n      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected\n  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter\n  requirements before October.\n      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on\n  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.\n      \"There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production\n  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,\" said an\n  international trader in Tokyo.

In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs\n  for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for\n  U.K. Brent, traders said.\n      They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into\n  the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate\n  (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.\n      \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import\n  Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those\n  grades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader.\n      Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot\n  market has further upward potential in the short term, having\n  risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.\n      \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that\n  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said\n  one international oil trader in Tokyo.\n      \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought\n  back up again pretty quickly,\" he added.\n      One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to\n  expect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to\n  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.\n      Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly\n  in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and\n  the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to\n  maintain steady prices.\n      Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day\n  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its\n  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline\n  through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.\n      Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,\n  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up\n  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.\n      Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating\n  on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price\n  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But\n  they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as\n  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher\n  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise\n  too high too fast.\n      Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln\n  barrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the\n  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises\n  too much,\" an oil industry analyst said.\n  \n\n",

The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and\n  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.\n      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of\n  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and\n  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord\n  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.\n      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and\n  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter\n  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth\n  quarter.\n      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore\n  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from\n  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained\n  within its December accord on output and prices.\n      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around\n  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln\n  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.\n      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since\n  February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.\n      Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for\n  a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement\n  on the latest oil production cutbacks.\n      Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC\n  producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia\n  and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep\n  prices stable.\n      Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an\n  OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around\n  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.\n      Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export\n  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price\n  during the first half of 1986.\n      But firmer oil prices since then have brought some\n  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade\n  deficit.\n       Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently\n  refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to\n  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.\n  \n\n",

In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter\n  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter\n  target.\n      Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third\n  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while\n  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\"\n      Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production\n  levels would have on prices.\n      Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,\n  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to\n  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln\n  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia\n  and Turkey.

        "CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW\n  U.S. moves to increase its warships in\n  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on\n  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a\n  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.\n      They said the American decision inevitably carries some\n  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt\n  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.\n      \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the\n  Gulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat.\n      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks\n  on \"soft targets\" such as merchant shipping not protected by\n  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.\n      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil\n  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated\n  by diplomats as low. However, \"There is the threat that the\n  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\n  will go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.\n      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\n  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\n  \"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"\n      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\n  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\n  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\n  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\n  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\n      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\n  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\n      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\n  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\n  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\n      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\n  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\n      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\n  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\n  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\n      \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\n  territory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving\n  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.\n      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\n  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\n      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\n  last Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event\n  of any U.S. strike against Iran.\n      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\n  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\n  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\n      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\n  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\n  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential\n  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.\n      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or\n  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.\n  \n\n",

Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.\n      The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining\n  with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal\n  tender offer.\n      But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was\n  dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.\n      In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,\n  the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply\n  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.\n      Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it\n  became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and\n  quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.\n  \n\n",

        "POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN\n  Rises in West German and international\n  interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has\n  no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank\n  President Karl Otto Poehl said.\n      \"We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred\n  here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,\"\n  Poehl told an investment conference.\n      \"I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest\n  in higher capital market rates,\" he said.\n      Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a\n  tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80\n  pct.\n      Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have\n  seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct\n  at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in\n  late September.\n      The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to\n  3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections\n  of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.\n      These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting\n  between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.\n  Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.\n      Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed\n  their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.\n      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in\n  West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the\n  dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.\n      But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in\n  nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.\n      Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not\n  due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and\n  currency developments.\n      Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said \"You\n  have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a\n  policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.\"\n   The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he\n  said.\n      Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,\n  saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to\n  international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.\n      The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money\n  supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.\n      \"Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of\n  1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest\n  rates have risen substantially more,\" Poehl said.\n      This had to be taken into account when considering recent\n  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to\n  rising international money market rates that had spilled over\n  into the German market, he said.\n      Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far\n  ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.\n      \"The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is\n  definitely underway,\" he said, noting that this was not so\n  noticeable in absolute figures.\n      The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also\n  attracted little attention, he said.\n  \n\n",

        "PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL\n  The Philippine coconut industry has\n  greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill\n  requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.\n      The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture\n  Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year\n  in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.\n      \"Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the\n  bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another\n  Senate bill,\" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of\n  the Philippines (UCAP).\n      PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with\n  eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.\n      The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association\n  (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.\n      He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during\n  the debate.\n      \"Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated\n  animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems\n  leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,\" he said.\n      U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that\n  saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would\n  discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour\n  of domestic unsaturated alternatives.\n      Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated\n  against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and\n  Indonesia.\n      The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products\n  in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.\n      Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use\n  account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.\n  \n\n",
        "TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY\n  Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent\n  the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even\n  force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,\n  government and private economists said.\n      A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark\n  further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major\n  deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.\n      Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently\n  maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount\n  rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. \n      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the\n  central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance\n  higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.\n      But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15\n  pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to\n  raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a\n  renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.\n      Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the\n  markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded\n  the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount\n  rate increase.\n      A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.\n  And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a\n  further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to\n  support the stock and security markets,\" he said.\n      But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change\n  policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central\n  bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices\n  continue to plunge during the rest of the week.\n      Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the\n  economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary\n  impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.\n      With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in\n  stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and\n  business confidence, one government economist said.\n      \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't\n  be that big,\" said another.\n      Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their\n  own, although they do participate through trust funds and other\n  investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned\n  to financial market investments for profits during last year's\n  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to\n  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.\n      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is\n  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have\n  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase\n  inventories and step up capital spending, one government\n  economist said.\n      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price\n  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices\n  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a\n  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,\n  one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a\n  couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.\n  \n\n",

With imports again large in September, it\n  estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by\n  October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.\n      EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year\n  earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,\n  sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to\n  bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record\n  5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.

        "NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG\n  The Soviets have not indicated an\n  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely\n  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit\n  expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard\n  Lyng told Reuters.\n      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did\n  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat\n  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.\n      \"Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.\n  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that\n  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a\n  wheat subsidy).\"\n      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet\n  summit, Lyng said, \"No, I don't think so. I don't think that.\"\n      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to\n  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for\n  discussion at a summit.\n      \"It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the\n  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions\n  about,\" Lyng said.\n      \"When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for\n  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was\n  not something that would be discussed with the President of the\n  United States. He said it's not presidential,\" Lyng said.\n      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major\n  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the\n  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final\n  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.\n      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement\n  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the\n  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the\n  long-standing agreement.\n      \"We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have\n  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would\n  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,\n  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.\n  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.\"\n      When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from\n  the agreement, Lyng said, \"I don't know. It certainly hasn't\n  been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running\n  they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an\n  agreement.\"\n  \n\n",

The\n  amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have\n  indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in\n  whatever way they deem most valuable,\" he said.\n      There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would\n  offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export\n  enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419\n  of an amended 1949 law.\n      Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree\n  on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that\n  Washington would prefer the package include something other\n  than donated food.\n      \"The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care\n  of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in\n  its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in\n  that,\" Lyng said.\n      \"We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we\n  still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the\n  import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we\n  always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to\n  cooperate with them,\" he said.\n      Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials\n  during Gandhi's visit here, adding, \"I just don't know of\n  anything that might be announced specifically.\"\n      Asked if \"the ball was in the Indians' court,\" he said, \"Yes.\"\n      Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.\n  \n\n",

        "LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS\n  U.S. And West German reaffirmation of\n  support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental\n  problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the\n  current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.\n      \"There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the\n  dollar is going to be allowed to slip,\" said Richard Jeffrey of\n  Hoare Govett. \"If not, there is going to be continued fear that\n  when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to\n  tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the\n  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\"\n      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which\n  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the\n  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation\n  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.\n      \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street\n  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said\n  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from\n  other London and Tokyo analysts.\n      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of\n  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary\n  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.\n      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the\n  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.\n      \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of\n  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their\n  interest rates,\" he added.\n      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime\n  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed\n  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial\n  system.\n      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock\n  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking\n  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.\n      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of\n  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said\n  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and\n  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in\n  mind.\n      \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.\n  If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic\n  growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a\n  more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's\n  Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in\n  danger.\n      \"The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is\n  disappearing from the equity markets,\" Dennis noted.\n      David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world\n  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven\n  (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,\n  as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies\n  is still on.\n      Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by\n  expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money\n  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency\n  stability.\n      But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said\n  Morrison. \"The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To\n  stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,\" he said.\n  \n\n",

        "U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA\n  An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg\n  surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to\n  nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as\n  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,\n  economists said.\n      An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the\n  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit\n  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.\n      \"In the normal course of events the markets would have been\n  extremely worried about that figure,\" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.\n  Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.\n      After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,\n  which compared won stg August rise, U.K.\n  Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee\n  from plummetting equities into the relative security of\n  government securities.\n      Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a\n  day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,\n  before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone\n  throughout.\n      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,\n  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning\n  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.\n      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks\n  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a\n  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, \"With\n  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last\n  thing the Bank of England would want to do,\" Spencer said.\n      \"The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as\n  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,\"\n  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu\n  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money\n  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct\n  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.\n      But \"The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed\n  down is a rather encouraging sign,\" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.\n  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a\n  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money\n  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.\n      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank\n  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates\n  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by\n  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.\n      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in\n  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.\n      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in\n  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.\n      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity\n  markets in the past few days, \"There will almost certainly be a\n  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail\n  sales,\" Temperton said.\n      \"Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in\n  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,\" he added.\n      \"I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending\n  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very\n  serious panic and a flight to quality,\" Spencer said.\n      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look\n  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,\n  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly\n  than bank lending.\n      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending\n  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy\n  personal sector borrowing.\n      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed\n  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66\n  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much\n  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.\n  \n\n",

        "GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG\n  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\n  said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint\n  against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in\n  negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.\n      The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan\n  end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the\n  end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will\n  favor the U.S.\n      \"These are quota items, and the principles that apply to\n  them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of\n  whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,\" Lyng\n  told Reuters in an interview.\n      He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on\n  beef and citrus after March 31, next year.\n      The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United\n  States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some\n  cheeses and specialty fruit juices.\n      U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would\n  be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has\n  been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.\n      The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus\n  quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect\n  Japanese farmers.\n      \"We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on\n  beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an\n  illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.\n      He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next\n  April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.\n  \n\n",

        "ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT\n  The American Soybean Association (ASA)\n  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal\n  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and\n  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not\n  remedy the situation.\n      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored\n  Outlook 87 conference: \"It will be filed unless the EC takes\n  drastic and immediate steps.\"\n      \"These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,\n  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was\n  established in 1962,\" he said.\n      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask\n  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to\n  make the regime non-discriminatory.\n      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in\n  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production\n  has risen dramatically since then.\n      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world\n  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial\n  oils and fats tax.\n      The subsidies \"are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero\n  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,\" Adams\n  said.\n      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its\n  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an\n  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the\n  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.\n      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in\n  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of\n  EC policies, Adams added.\n      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at\n  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973\n  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.\n  \n\n",
        "U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES\n  The United States is prepared to \"pull out\n  all the stops\" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the\n  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador\n  to GATT Michael Samuels said.\n      Those rights are now being challenged by the European\n  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a\n  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.\n      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if\n  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without\n  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.\n      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect\n  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat\n  shipments into the EC.\n      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.\n  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed\n  prices over the current market level and which may be extended\n  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.\n      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,\n  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade\n  negotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be\n  erected,\" Samuels said.\n      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm\n  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\"\n  and \"very serious.\"  The EC and Japan have said it is\n  unrealistic.\n      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal\n  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally\n  next week.\n      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce\n  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals\n  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of\n  farm subsidies.\n      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as\n  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major\n  trade distortions, Samuels said.\n      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally\n  submitted and respond to it officially then.\n      \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este\n  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\"\n  the U.S. Ambassador said.\n      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores\n  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.\n      The key difference between the two approaches is that the\n  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing\n  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.\n      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,\n  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to\n  correct the international trade situation, he added.\n      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC\n  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to\n  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the\n  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.\n  \n\n",

        "BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE\n  The United States appears to have won a\n  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest\n  rates, European economists said.\n      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing\n  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were\n  plunging.\n      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.\n  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to\n  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,\n  according to official statements released late Monday.\n      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the\n  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks\n  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct\n  facility rate offered last week.\n      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank\n  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added\n  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a\n  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.\n       \"It's round one to the Americans, \" said Richard Reid,\n  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in\n  London.\n      But Reid added, \"We shouldn't forget that it has taken one\n  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West\n  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05\n  percentage point.\"\n      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening\n  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and\n  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.\n      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's\n  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary\n  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\n  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\n  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\n  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\n  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\n      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\n  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\n  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\n  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\n      \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\n  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\n  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.\n      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\n  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\n  in the U.S., Aschoff said.\n      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\n  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\n  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\n      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\n  Ltd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\n  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\n  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\n  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"\n      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\n  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\n  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\n      Economists said the United States now appeared to have\n  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\n  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\n      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\n  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\n  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\n  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\n  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\n      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\n  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\n  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central\n  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them\n  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.\n  \n\n",

        "EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA\n  The European Community (EC) agreed a\n  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country\n  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC\n  officials said.\n      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina\n  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products\n  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.\n      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with\n  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the\n  officials said.\n      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC\n  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased\n  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.\n      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,\n  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals\n  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the\n  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from\n  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the\n  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500\n  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will\n  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.\n      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of\n  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced\n  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.\n      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said\n  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their\n  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They\n  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement\n  on Tariffs and Trade).\n      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve\n  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had\n  been affected by the country's EC membership.\n      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the\n  fish dispute with Canada.\n      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC\n  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has\n  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied\n  with Japanese offers of compensation.\n      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on\n  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some\n  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear\n  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.\n      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told\n  journalists: \"We maintain our position that the (Japanese)\n  concessions were not enough.\"\n      \"We hope that there will be an improvement,\" he said.\n  \n\n",

        "US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS\n  U.S. military planners ruled out\n  Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack\n  mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the\n  Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.\n      U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and\n  raided another in what the administration called a \"measured and\n  appropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last\n  Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.\n      Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig\n  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as\n  Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to\n  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at\n  home and in the Gulf.\n      \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military\n  action when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a\n  defense analyst and author, said.\n      He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the\n  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding\n  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.\n      In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the\n  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that\n  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.\n      Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq\n  war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target\n  to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General\n  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a\n  Security Council call for a ceasefire.\n      \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any\n  chance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear\n  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.\n  \n     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon\n  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington\n  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's\n  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had\n  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the\n  lower Gulf.\n      \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown\n  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting\n  capabilities,\" Cordesman said.\n      He predicted the United States would respond to any future\n  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar\n  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the\n  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.\n      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the\n  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but\n  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action\n  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\" \n  \n\n",

For the remaining 52.6\n  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one\n  Irving share.\n      At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to\n  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per\n  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.\n      According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender\n  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.\n      Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would\n  affect the acquisition.\n      \"If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve\n  it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,\"\n  said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.\n      \"And the market is saying the deal won't go through,\"\n  Alpert said.\n      \"The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at\n  present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a\n  share, then they won't go at a lower price,\" another analyst\n  said.\n      The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford\n  to retain its original offer.\n      However, industry sources were more uncertain about\n  prospects for the deal.\n      \"With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will\n  look good to Irving shareholders,\" said Michael Flores, a\n  consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.\n      The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is\n  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases\n  the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.\n      Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely\n  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking\n  industry.\n      \"Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use\n  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price\n  is too depressed,\" Alpert said.\n      Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other\n  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.\n      \"In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered\n  more than the acquirees,\" another analyst said.\n  \n\n",

        "TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP\n  As official Washington sought to\n  restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street\n  collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from\n  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.\n      Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for\n  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an\n  international accord to stabilize currency values.\n      Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was\n  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped\n  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors\n  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would\n  damage the world economy.\n      Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, \"I\n  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I\n  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by\n  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a\n  dispute that should never have happened, he added.\n      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a\n  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  \n  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United\n  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to\n  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.\n      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His\n  timing could not have been worse.\"\n      One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually\n  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack\n  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much\n  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"\n      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\n  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\n      \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\n  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\n  markets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of\n  Nikko Securities International in New York.\n      \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\n  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the\n  messenger,\" he said.\n      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\n  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\n  in Paris in February, was still in effect.\n      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\n  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\n  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\n  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\n     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\n  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\n  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\n  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\n      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\n  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\n  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\n  market for debtor country exports.\n      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\n  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential\n  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\n  tarnished.\n      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\n  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\n  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\n      \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\n  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\n  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\n  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"\n  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\n  television interview.\n      In many ways, the official response was mild.\n      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\n  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\n  that he was \"puzzled.\"\n      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\n  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\n  and, presumably, their political impact.\n      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\n  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.\n      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\n  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\n  Bentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to\n  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\n  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\n  retire to the living room to take a nap.

The\n  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet\n  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.\n      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove\n  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and\n  many services.\n      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli\n  pacts \"other countries have realized that if they want to\n  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had\n  better get serious about improving the GATT.\"\n      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing\n  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially\n  increase the gross national products in both countries.\n      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should\n  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.\n      Yeutter said, \"increasing trade is one of the keys to\n  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.\"\n      He said, \"a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only\n  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries\n  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards\n  of living.\"\n      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress\n  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to\n  protectionism.\n      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress\n  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions\n  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United\n  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.\n      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade\n  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still\n  rising.\n      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to\n  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President\n  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.\n      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.\n      He said, \"President Reagan will veto any bill that contains\n  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.\"\n  \n\n",
        "BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS\n  News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury\n  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard\n  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the\n  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.\n      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great\n  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by\n  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears\n  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.\n      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two\n  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.\n      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by\n  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously\n  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York\n  markets.\n      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies\n  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry\n  spokesman in Bonn said.\n      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of\n  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\n  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\n  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\n  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\n  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\n  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\n  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\n  deficit.\n      West German government sources said rising West German\n  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\n  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\n  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\n  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\n  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n      German yields have also risen over this period, but less\n  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\n  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security\n  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\n  money market.\n      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\n  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\n  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\n  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\n  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\n  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\n  bank economists said.\n      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\n  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\n  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\n  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\n  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\n  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\n  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n      \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\n  under American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\n  Swiss Bank Corp here.\n      \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\n  significant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\n  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\n  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\n  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\n  economists said.\n      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\n  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\n  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\n  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\n  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance\n  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\n  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\n  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\n  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\n  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit\n  Denmark and Belgium.\n  \n\n",

If vital supplies were cut off,\n  Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.\n      Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic\n  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an\n  arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.\n      He said the United States should also threaten to mine and\n  blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to\n  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a\n  settlement.\n      Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by\n  invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the\n  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style\n  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.\n      Each side has attacked the others' shipping.\n  \n\n",

It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated\n  anything because it wasn't working in the first place.\"\n      A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:\n  \"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up\n  ...

Eugene Carroll\n  of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)\n  think tank.\n      Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for\n  Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to\n  the war between Iran and Iraq.\n      They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its\n  30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began\n  escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal \n  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which\n  President Reagan could never accept.\n      U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon\n  news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel\n  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam\n  oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf\n  time (0700 EDT) on Monday.\n      Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military\n  base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian\n  Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea\n  Isle City on Friday.\n      Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and\n  allowed to escape.\n      \"We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will\n  be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran\n  with stronger countermeasures,\" Weinberger said.\n      \"We consider this matter closed,\" he said.\n      Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives\n  agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not\n  escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was\n  whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken\n  this view after earlier clashes.\n  \n\n",

        "AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT\n  Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on\n  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains\n  that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the\n  Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.\n      December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before\n  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.\n      \"Fundamentals are awful,\" said Philip Lambert, analyst with\n  stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC\n  production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln\n  bpd, little changed from September levels.\n      Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC\n  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and\n  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September\n  production at 18.5 mln bpd.\n      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of\n  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea\n  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,\n  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag\n  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.\n      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the\n  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.\n      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on\n  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.\n  Attack, analysts said.\n      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which\n  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in\n  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.\n      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in\n  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf\n  hostilities, analysts said.\n      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian\n  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.\n      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,\n  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.\n      \"The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond\n  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any\n  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.\n  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,\" Pyne said.\n      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was \"a\n  responsible retaliation,\" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to\n  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran\n  chose to raise the level of conflict.\n      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.\n      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as\n  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests\n  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a\n  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian\n  retaliation.\n      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a\n  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which\n  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile\n  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.\n      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy\n  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary\n  Caspar Weinburger.\n      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the\n  Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less\n  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,\n  analysts and traders said.\n  \n\n",

He has just declared all bets\n  are off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency\n  analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.\n      But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine\n  view, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently\n  reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker\n  comment will regret it later on.\"\n      French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the\n  Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to\n  respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful\n  and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the\n  Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"\n      Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British\n  Treasury commented on the row.\n      But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite\n  U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does\n  not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the\n  Louvre Accord.\"\n      In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive\n  of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that\n  following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.\n  Was still committed to the accord.\n      In a move which the market interpreted as a possible\n  gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term\n  liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on\n  Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected\n  medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also\n  stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,\n  injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose\n  close to eight pct.\n  \n\n",

It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year\n  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.\n      Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting\n  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining\n  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2\n  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the\n  spokesman said.\n      British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.\n      The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,\n  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories\n  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the\n  campaign.\n      As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been\n  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13\n  pct had been lifted.

        "SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS\n  The Soviet Union outlined its economic\n  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve\n  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.\n      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet\n  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a\n  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.\n      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent\n  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a\n  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the\n  output of a country's goods and services.\n      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of\n  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow\n  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.\n      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described\n  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is\n  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on\n  world markets.\n      \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the\n  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a\n  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said\n  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.\n      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\n  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\n  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987\n  compared with the same period last year.\n      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned\n  for the industry for the whole of 1988.\n      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent\n  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\n  a large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale\n  measures are planned to save resources,\" he said.\n      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that\n  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same\n  figure as was announced last year.\n      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for\n  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure\n  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are\n  intertwined with the civilian economy.\n      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending\n  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social\n  insurance schemes.\n  \n\n",

        "SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN\n  Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key\n  supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least\n  the next five years, oil industry sources said.\n      Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and\n  butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi\n  Arabian LPG, the sources said.\n      They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate\n  of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. \"Saudi\n  is a reliable supplier in that sense,\" said one trader.\n      Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.\n      No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an\n  LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.\n      \"Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,\n  which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf\n  could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities\n  in that area,\" said another trader.\n      Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20\n  pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at\n  Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to\n  contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from\n  other ports.\n      Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude\n  rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG\n  supply disruptions, traders said.\n      They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was\n  unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.\n      Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly\n  rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a\n  moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.\n      Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift\n  slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from\n  Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.\n      The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in\n  large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian\n  LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the\n  year ended March 1987, the sources said.\n      But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down\n  term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on\n  the spot market, they said.\n      Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which\n  5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term\n  contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of\n  Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.\n      Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made\n  some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the\n  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the\n  Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.\n      The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been\n  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to\n  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.\n      Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by\n  Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87\n  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)\n  of Arabian Light.\n      Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings\n  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian\n  Light's GSP.\n      Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the\n  95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,\n  the trade sources said.\n      Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying\n  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to\n  seller-buyer agreement.\n      Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut\n  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.\n      \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable\n  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said\n  an official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for\n  cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a\n  longer haul and war risk insurance payments.\"\n      Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to\n  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on\n  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to\n  current levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we\n  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of\n  high dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.\n  \n\n",

        "GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION\n  Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's\n  central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are\n  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the\n  central bank's independence.\n      But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,\n  president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a\n  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of\n  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.\n      Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last\n  Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and\n  interest rates\n      Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's\n  criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place\n  for foreign investors.\n      \"The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and\n  Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign\n  investors,\" said one economist for a London broker, who asked\n  not to be identified.\n      Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial\n  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to\n  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.\n      \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will result\n  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill\n  feeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.\n      News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct\n  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in\n  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and\n  abroad.\n      Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the\n  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the\n  Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting\n  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.\n      Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under\n  extraordinary pressures lately.\n      Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his\n  deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight\n  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had\n  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.\n      In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like\n  Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been\n  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\n  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\n  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\n  views, bankers said.\n      \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\n  Pfister.\n      \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\n  entirely his own,\" said another economist.\n      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\n  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\n  and hurting West German exporters.\n      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\n  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\n  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\n  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\n  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\n  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\n  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\n  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\n  most popular government politician last year, had to face\n  resistance from local barons in the government coalition\n  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n  4.3 billion marks.\n      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\n  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\n  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\n  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\n  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of\n  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\n  allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\n  losses for the CDU in state elections.\n      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\n  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\n  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\n  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\n  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\n  gave Poehl another eight-year term.\n      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\n  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\n  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\n  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n  \n\n",

A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he\n  noted.\n      A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in\n  monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would\n  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar\n  against the mark or the yen.\n      The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between\n  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.\n      The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and\n  141.35 yen.\n      \"Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher\n  interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this\n  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework\n  of the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said.\n      He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any\n  further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only\n  hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt\n  problem.\n      Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their\n  interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets\n  further, the monetary officials said.\n      Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined\n  to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further\n  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary\n  expectations in the U.S.\n      \"That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre\n  agreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry official\n  said.\n      Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that\n  Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West\n  Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.\n      The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\n  Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar\n  decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,\n  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the\n  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.\n      But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional\n  statement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" and\n  this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the\n  dealers said.\n      Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in\n  Tokyo currency markets.\n      The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised\n  pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates\n  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,\n  or international economic policy coordination.\n      The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\n  France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's\n  economic policies and from time to time apply \"peer pressure\" to\n  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,\n  they noted. \"Without such a basic agreement of multilateral\n  surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German\n  policy so openly,\" the ministry official said.\n      The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy\n  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy\n  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse\n  of the Louvre agreement, the official said.\n      He also said Japan has not received any specific request\n  from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term\n  money rates have been edging higher.\n      \"This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking\n  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate\n  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,\" he\n  added.\n  \n\n",

        "RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE\n  International Rubber Organisation\n  (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had\n  shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but\n  acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.\n      \"We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well\n  from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in\n  proper conditions does not deteriorate,\" he told Reuters in a\n  telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold\n  since he entered the market in September would be discussed at\n  an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.\n      Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in\n  buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible\n  poor quality.\n      Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the\n  \"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's\n  five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October\n  16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock\n  was uppermost in consumers' minds.\n      \"We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand\n  the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber\n  before they carry on buying,\" he said.\n      Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different\n  locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all\n  warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.\n      Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the\n  past week to 10 days and this could reflect a \"wait and see\n  attitude\" by buyers, he said.\n      \"Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts\n  until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,\n  they are likely to buy more.\" Hofmeister said he could reduce\n  the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest\n  but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.\n      Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates\n  that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur\n  and New York since September.\n      But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an\n  idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall\n  had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.\n      The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne\n  buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council\n  meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.\n      The current international rubber pact expires on October\n  22.\n      The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and\n  Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during\n  the interim period.\n  \n\n",
        "ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR\n  An income tax surcharge and capital\n  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of\n  the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.\n      Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the\n  Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to\n  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by\n  current government policies.\n      The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn\n  would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.\n  He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could\n  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.\n      Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a\n  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was\n  probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.\n      He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct\n  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,\n  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.\n  Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary\n  impact of a currency depreciation.\n      The government had failed to bring inflation down despite\n  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.\n      New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to\n  end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.\n      The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation\n  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and\n  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss\n  said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt\n  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.\n      \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are\n  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought\n  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's\n  macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.\n  \n\n",

        "TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN\n  Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching\n  nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the\n  significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.\n      \"The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is\n  considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the\n  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,\"\n  said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi\n  Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.\n      The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday\n  closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.\n      The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of\n  140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York\n  and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.\n      The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.\n  Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.\n      \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish\n  sentiment after Baker's comments,\" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He\n  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among\n  the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the\n  Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.\n      The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day\n  drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness\n  in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.\n      Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he\n  strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest\n  rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience\n  with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord\n  due to their fears of increasing inflation.\n      Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary\n  pressures also slow domestic demand.\n      West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to\n  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade\n  deficit, Tanaka said.\n      U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still\n  massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest\n  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.\n      \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations\n  coordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi,\n  deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange\n  department.\n      The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally\n  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.\n      \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near\n  future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations\n  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre\n  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\"\n  Hirabayashi said.

Separate import and export figures were not given.\n      One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction\n  of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last\n  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,\n  irrespective of quality.\n      Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader\n  Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special\n  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below\n  standard.\n      Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were\n  rejected in the nine-month period.\n      The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more\n  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000\n  people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,\n  Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.\n      The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the\n  economy has been an important part of the modernisation\n  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the\n  setting up of small shops on a private basis.\n      Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months\n  against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.\n      But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity\n  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in\n  the West, which measures worker output over a given period.\n      Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union\n  as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5\n  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period\n  last year.
